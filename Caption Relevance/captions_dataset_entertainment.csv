abGCYPCk294,"Justice League Reactions, Should Disney Buy Netflix - The John Campea Show","On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Saturday, November 11th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nVIEWER TOPICS\n\nRob Sanders - Hi John. Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there‚Äôs nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I‚Äôve been excited for the movie but don‚Äôt know how to take the limited reactions I‚Äôve been seeing. Help.\n\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that‚Äôs the case, why doesn‚Äôt Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\n\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?"

coOKvrsmQiI,RAMPAGE - OFFICIAL TRAILER 1 [HD],"In Theaters April 20, 2018\n\nwww.RampageTheMovie.com\nwww.facebook.com/RampageTheMovie\nwww.twitter.com/RampageTheMovie\nwww.instagram.com/RampageTheMovie\n\n--\n\nGlobal megastar Dwayne Johnson headlines the action adventure ‚ÄúRampage,‚Äù directed by Brad Peyton.  \n\nPrimatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson), a man who keeps people at a distance, shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla who has been in his care since birth.  But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it‚Äôs soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n ‚ÄúRampage‚Äù also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (‚ÄúMoonlight‚Äù), Malin Akerman (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBillions‚Äù), Jake Lacy (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúGirls‚Äù), Joe Manganiello (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Blood‚Äù) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù); as well as P.J. Byrne (‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street‚Äù), Marley Shelton (‚ÄúSolace‚Äù), Breanne Hill (‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù), Jack Quaid (‚ÄúThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire‚Äù), and Matt Gerald (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúDaredevil‚Äù). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\n‚ÄúRampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit ‚ÄúSan Andreas.‚Äù  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, ‚ÄúStar Wars: The Last Jedi‚Äù), editor Jim May (‚ÄúGoosebumps‚Äù) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (‚ÄúDawn of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for ‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù and ‚ÄúJourney 2: The Mysterious Island.‚Äù\nThe ‚ÄúRampage‚Äù creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (‚ÄúSan Andreas,‚Äù ‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse‚Äù), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù Trilogy, ‚ÄúDawn of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù).\n\n‚ÄúRampage‚Äù opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, ‚ÄúRampage‚Äù will be distributed by Warner Bros.

Nz0qoOgyWSQ,"The Talk - Eve Reacts to Nicki Minaj's Racy Magazine Cover, 'I just don't think it's right'","Paper Magazine debuted a racy cover featuring Nicki Minaj. Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing.

Y2-JjnW3w2g,"Who Matt Reeves Wants As Batman, Is Basmati Blues Culturally Insensitive? The John Campe Show","On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Thursday, November 16th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nShahrukh Ali - My question is how can the studios release films that have seemingly incomplete or poor CGI ? Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\n\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\n\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\n\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as it‚Äôs always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\n\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point. Is Matt Reeves is still working on a stand alone Batman film or would that be cancelled if Affleck walks?"
PGWBA_OzCE4,Deadpool 2 Teaser Released - Movie Talk,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday November 15th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Kristian Harloff, Jon Schnepp, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \n\n-First teaser released for Daedpool 2\n\n-Rotten Tomatoes Will Delay the Reveal of ‚ÄòJustice League‚Äôs Tomatometer Score\n\n-Tarantino‚Äôs next movie down to 3 studio front-runners Sony, Paramount and WB; Tom Cruise eyed for lead role\n\n-Animated Super Mario Bros. movie in development at Illumination and Universal\n\n-‚ÄòHalloween‚Äô Reboot Timeline Confirmed by Danny McBride\n\n-What Women Want remake ‚ÄòWhat Men Want‚Äô in the works at Paramount; Empire‚Äôs Taraji P. Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won‚Äôt be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET‚Äînearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there‚Äôs a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it‚Äôs likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination‚Äôs Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse‚Äôs new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we‚Äôll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‚Äòs Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues.

Watch the new trailer for #12StrongMovie.\n‚Äî\nChris Hemsworth and Oscar nominee, Michael Shannon, star in 12 STRONG, a powerful new war drama from Alcon Entertainment, Black Label Media and Jerry Bruckheimer Films. \n\nSet in the harrowing days following 9/11, a U.S. Special Forces team, led by their new Captain, Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), is chosen to be the first U.S. troops sent into Afghanistan for an extremely dangerous mission. There, in the rugged mountains, they must convince Northern Alliance General Dostum (Navid Negahban) to join forces with them to fight their common adversary: the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies. In addition to overcoming mutual distrust and a vast cultural divide, the Americans‚Äîaccustomed to state-of-the-art warfare‚Äîmust adopt the rudimentary tactics of the Afghani horse soldiers. But despite their uneasy bond, the new allies face overwhelming odds: outnumbered and outgunned by a ruthless enemy that does not take prisoners.\n\nDirected by Nicolai Fuglsig and based on the acclaimed ‚ÄúHorse Soldiers‚Äù book by best-selling author Doug Stanton, 12 STRONG also stars Michael Pe√±a, Navid Negahban, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, Austin Stowell, Ben O‚ÄôToole, Austin Hebert, Kenneth Miller, Kenny Sheard, Jack Kesy, Laith Nakli, Fahim Fazli, Yousuf Azami, Said Taghmaoui, Elsa Pataky, William Fichtner, and Rob Riggle.\n‚Äî\nFollow #12StrongMovie on social media:\nhttp://12strongmovie.com \nhttp://facebook.com/12StrongMovie \nhttp://twitter.com/12StrongMovie \nhttp://instagram.com/12StrongMovie"

7cTi6PHUqMw,Are Critics What Killed Justice League? Sony Pay Too Much For Tarantino? - The John Campea Show,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Tuesday, November 21st 2017) John talks about the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nMeghan Dunn - I really liked Murder on the Orient Express and I just heard that Fox is setting up a sequel with Death on the Nile. Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JL‚Äôs poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about. Do you have any thoughts on their marketing of this movie so far?"

But against a budget of $150 million, the film only made $212 million at the box office, making its sequel prospects unlikely. Now, 15 years later, Russell Crowe has taken to his Twitter account saying a Master and Commander sequel may actually be happening. \n\nWhile it‚Äôs very hard to score a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, it‚Äôs not impossible. In the history of the aggregator site, only one movie has scored a perfect 100 and that was Toy Story 2, with 163 reviews certified fresh. But now, we have a new champion and it comes in the form of Greta Gerwig‚Äôs Lady Bird. The film now has 164 reviews, all of them ‚ÄúFresh‚Äù, giving the film a 100% Fresh rating, as well as crowning it the best reviewed movie of all time. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Perri: https://twitter.com/PNemiroff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

Lily has turned into a polished, upper-class teenager, with a fancy boarding school on her transcript and a coveted internship on her resume; Amanda has developed a sharp wit and her own particular attitude, but all in the process of becoming a social outcast. Though they initially seem completely at odds, the pair bond over Lily's contempt for her oppressive stepfather, Mark, and as their friendship grows, they begin to bring out one another's most destructive tendencies. Their ambitions lead them to hire a local hustler, Tim, and take matters into their own hands to set their lives straight.\n\nhttp://www.ThoroughbredsMovie.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ThoroughbredsMovie\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thoroughbreds/\nhttps://twitter.com/thoroughbreds"

6d6SmcYcP_U,Twitter Is FURIOUS VS Fashion Show Aired Model's Runway Fall UNEDITED,"Thank you to Xfinity Mobile for sponsoring this episode. Learn more about Xfinity Mobile ‚Äì a new kind of network that combines America‚Äôs largest most reliable 4G LTE with the most WiFi hotspots. http://bit.ly/XFINITY_MOBILE\n\nMore Celebrity News ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nWelp, turns out CBS decided not to edit out model Ming Xi (SHEE)‚Äôs fall during last night‚Äôs airing of the Victoria Secret fashion show. This episode of Newsfeed is brought to you by Xfinity Mobile. It‚Äôs a new kind of network.\n\nSooo that‚Äôs embarrassing‚Ä¶\n\nRumor was that CBS would probably edit out Ming‚Äôs fall on the catwalk at last week‚Äôs pre-taped Victoria Secret fashion show‚Ä¶After all, CBS has taken out other awkward flubs at the show in the past, like last year when Ariana Grande got smacked in the face with angel wings. But that was not the case with this tumble.\nYa know why they didn‚Äôt cut this out? Because it was TV gold and great publicity. I mean, we‚Äôre talking about it right now and so are most media outlets. To amp up the drama further, they sliced in backstage audio from the producers. Check this out‚Ä¶\n\nIt‚Äôs truly like a car crash. I don‚Äôt want to look, but I have to. My friend and editor at Cosmopolitan, Alex Rees, shares my sentiments, tweeting‚Ä¶‚Äùomg and she's crying (tbh its a bit f-ed up to air this part imho but then i recorded the footage to share on twitter so i dont really have a point i guess).‚Äù\nIt got even sadder when they show Ming in tears after exiting the runway.\n\nFans have been vocal about their feelings about the final edit of the show on twitter. \n\nOne viewer tweeted, ‚ÄúPretty uncool of Victoria's Secret to not only show Ming Xi fall, but then also show her crying backstage.‚Äù\nAnother viewer was annoyed that they didn‚Äôt use footage from the dress rehearsal instead writing, ‚ÄúThe vsfs is filmed twice. I‚Äôm disgusted that they showed Ming Xi fall, like honestly? Why did they do her like that? They embarrassed her in front of millions of people. I‚Äôm so disappointed in Victoria Secret right now.‚Äù\n\nUgh, poor, Ming. And if you thought it couldn‚Äôt be more embarrassing‚Ä¶the fall happened in front of a hometown crowd in Shanghai. The model wrote this in an Instagram caption following the incident last week. \n\n‚ÄúIt was no doubt one of the hardest moments I have ever had to go through in my career, especially since the show was taking place in my hometown, in front of my mother's and my people's eyes. However, the support I received from everyone yesterday was incredible and I am truly grateful to everyone who was there for me.‚Äù\n\nI know they‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúangels, but am I horrible for saying I appreciated this humanizing moment. We got to see genuine emotion, a fall‚Ä¶ literally and figuritively‚Ä¶ and a strong recovery. It‚Äôs kind of a hero story for me. What do you think?! Let me know in the comments section below. I‚Äôm your host Ashley Iaconetti, thanks for tuning in to Clevver. \n\nNow click left to see Harry Styles get his grove on the Victoria Secret fashion show.

MQSRmx9zS64,Top 10 Strangest Things That Happen To Your Body In Space,"Space is the final frontier. Being in zero gravity for extended periods of time does some wacky things to the human body. Unless aliens show up and teach us how to deal with these unique challenges, it‚Äôs up to scientists to discover ways for the human body to cope.\nSubscribe for more! ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/BeAmazedSubscribe ‚óÑ\nStay updated ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/BeAmazedFacebook https://twitter.com/BeAmazedVideos https://instagram.com/BeAmazedVideos ‚óÑ \nFor copyright queries or general inquiries please get in touch: beamazedvideos@gmail.com\nCredit: https://pastebin.com/zqUjCLhq\n\nBe Amazed at these Top 10 Things That Happen To Your Body In Space! Muscle Atrophy - Gravity, of course, is what allows you to walk around on the earth with your feet on the ground. In space, your main mode of transportation is floating instead.  Space Eurphoria - The mind is the most important part of the body, so how is it affected by living up in space? Many astronauts have reported that their time in space was a seriously enlightening and perspective changing time of their life. Space Radiation - Luckily for us down here on earth, our atmosphere protects us from cosmic radiation. However, Astronauts outside this atmosphere - out in space - do not have this luxurious blanket, and so they're exposed to ten times more radiation than they would be if they were on earth. Vision problems - If you spend too much time in space, the backs of your eyeballs will flatten just a tiny little bit. This is as bad as it sounds, and it causes your vision to blur. \n\nA Strange Smell - One question that isn‚Äôt really explored in many science fiction books or films is what exactly does space smell like? Wouldn‚Äôt it just smell like whatever earth smells like? Space Adaption Syndrome - If you go too long without earths‚Äô gravity holding down your body, you could end up with ‚Äúspace sickness‚Äù, formally known as space adaption syndrome. Confinement Craziness - If you have a family, a roommate, or have even simply interacted with another human being, you should know that if you put a bunch of people in a confined area for an extended period of time, problems are bound to arise. Your immune system gets worse - Space also takes a toll on your immune system, which you need to protect your body against diseases more than ever in space. You‚Äôll lose bone mass - Here on earth, you maintain your bones thanks to the natural power of gravity and mechanical loading. Osteoblasts, which are cells that regulate the bone matrix, and osteoclasts, which absorb one matrix, continually remodel your bone mass. Your heart weakens - The heart, perhaps the most important muscle you have, is also affected by a lack of gravity. The very size and shape of the human heart is changed by a trip to space."
PWrsHhAuVZg,"Queen Biopic Stops Production, Avengers Fighting Alien Cannon Fodder Again - The John Campea Show","On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Saturday, December 2nd 2017) John takes the following user submitted topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\n≈†√°rka Vajnerov√° - Hi John, i dare you pronounce my name correctly. I am fan  from Czech Republic. I grew up watching 90¬¥s X-Men cartoon and i loved it. I like X-Men movies but i was really disappointed in the portrayal of my favourite character, Gambit. I was looking forward for his solo movie. But I don't hear any news anymore. It¬¥s that movie still happening or not?\n\nJessica Kang - I wanted to know your thoughts on the upcoming Lucille Ball biopic.  As a HUGE Lucille Ball fan, it amazes me that they haven‚Äôt done a proper biopic on her yet.  She had such a fascinating life and I would love to see the backstage drama told without any sugarcoat.  Love your insight and your logic and of course, keep bringing on the filthy!\n\nTaylor Pechter - I've watched the Inifinty War trailer a few times. I enjoyed it, but one thing gave me pause. At the end of the trailer, you have The Avengers running at another army of faceless, canon-fodder monsters. Do you think this is the climax? I hope not because this has been a trope ever since the first Avengers and is kind of becoming tiresome. What do you think? \n\nAlijah Brown - Hey John deadpool 2 will definitely be a smash hit next year or at least that's what I assume. How do you think the film will hold up against a super blockbuster like Infinity war. 2018 is certainly packed with comic book movies. A lot of competition. Your thoughts?\n\nRoger Daultry - There are reports that Bryan Singer has gone awol several times during the shooting of the Queen Biopic and Fox has just halted production because of Singer‚Äôs ‚Äúunexpected unavailability‚Äù. His publicist put out a statement that it‚Äôs because of a family health matter. My question is: Do you believe him or is there a deeper problem happening here? I really want a great Queen movie!"

xkYpO9ATUT0,Riverdale | Mad World | The CW,"Riverdale is new Wednesdays at 8/7c only on The CW, and available next day on The CW App: http://go.cwtv.com/genRVRyt\n \nSUBSCRIBE: http://go.cwtv.com/YTSubscribe\n \nAbout RIVERDALE:\nAs a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom ‚Äî and nothing feels the same. Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer‚Äôs events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale‚Äôs young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It‚Äôs all weighing heavily on Archie‚Äôs mind ‚Äî as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she‚Äôs not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty‚Äôs nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (M√§dchen Amick), aren‚Äôt the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there‚Äôs an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn‚Äôt want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there‚Äôs Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale‚Äôs Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, RIVERDALE is from Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúGlee‚Äù), Greg Berlanti (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù), Sarah Schechter (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù) and Jon Goldwater (Archie Comics).\n\nConnect with RIVERDALE Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE : http://cwtv.com/shows/riverdale\nLike RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/CWRiverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CW_Riverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thecwriverdale/\n\nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow, Dynasty, Valor, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Black Lightning, and Life Sentence.\n\nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nRiverdale | Mad World | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision"

JP5BL-lCoQI,Why Avengers Infinity War Will Succeed Where Justice League Failed - The John Campea Show,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Tuesday, December 5th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nJerry Montgomery - I was one of the people who got frustrated at the Frozen short that played before Coco. Loved Coco, and the short wasn‚Äôt bad, but at north of 20 minutes long it just made for a lot longer evening for the kids than I was banking on. Did Disney actually hear the complaints and pull it from the screenings?\n\nHussain Shah - Hi John, congrats on 100,000 subs just waiting for the other 900,000 to find your fantastic channel. I'm wondering your thoughts on Netflix's Oscar chances? Do you feel they'll have a chance or do the academy just have a prejudice against online streaming? They're releasing a film a week next year, surely one will get recognised at least. \n\nVictor - Hi John, awesome show. Super baffled by 20th Century Fox‚Äôs decision to fire Bryan Singer from the Bohemian Rhapsody movie - especially after reading Singer‚Äôs comments about needing time for family health issues. Is this a smart move by 20th Century Fox? Why not keep him on board in some advisory capacity, whilst bringing in a co-director who can complete shooting? Something doesn‚Äôt add up... Thanks!\n\nZR J-Ro - My question was could Tarintino‚Äôs Star Trek be Rated R since most of, if not not all, of his movies are?\n\nRebecca VanDerween - I‚Äôm seeing a lot of excitement for Avengers Infinity War. The trailer was just amazing. But after the recent choke job of Justice League, should we be nervous that Infinity War could crash and burn like it did? Why should we feel confident that Avengers will work where Justice League failed?"

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris DeFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers. \n\n‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù stars Tye Sheridan (‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse,‚Äù ‚ÄúMud‚Äù), Olivia Cooke (‚ÄúMe and Earl and the Dying Girl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBates Motel‚Äù), Ben Mendelsohn (‚ÄúRogue One ‚Äì A Star Wars Story,‚Äù ‚ÄúBloodline‚Äù) and T.J.

8H0alk0e0tg,Could Kevin Feige Save DC? Does Alita Battle Angel Look Great Or Terrible? The John Campea Show,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Saturday, December 9th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nPATREON Supporter Jacob Bullard - Do you think Tarantino's association, regardless of the film's quality, will hamper the next Trek film's financial success? Django (Tarantino‚Äôs record) made $425mil. I fear many people, especially families, will avoid it because of assumptions drawn from Tarantino's past films. Even the general audience knows his movies are more extreme than average R-rated films. \n\nMathew Garet - Kind of a random question, do you find it as odd as I do that, JA Bayona isn't the one announcing trailers on social media, but it was actually Colin Trevorrow? Appreciate everything you do John! \n\nSamuel Polay - I just watched the trailer for Alita battle angel and my reaction can be summed in one word: disturbed. How did nobody at the studio notice these effects on Alita and immediately mandate reshoots that use just the actress' real face instead of this uncanny valley monstrosity? \n\nSebastian Dietz - Hey John, like always greetings from germany ;) in my opinion one of the first things disney should do after buying fox‚Äòs assets is split the production auf Avatar 2 and 3. (Yes i‚Äôm in the doubting J. Cameron business ;)) If Avatar 2 fails (and i think there are huge arguments that it could) it‚Äôs a big risk to already have spend the money on the production of the 3rd one. Much like the situation of JL and Aquaman. Thoughts?\nBryan K - If DC and WB offered Kevin Feige a huge pay bump to jump ship to build their DCU do you think Kevin would go and would you want him to? Kevin has already done so much for Marvel he may won't a new challenge and fresh start?\n\n**DC logo art by Piebytwo"

S7kG641iA_g,Cardistry - Virtuoso : RISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck,"The new FW17 Virtuoso deck is launching soon. \nLearn more about this deck and Cardistry at https://thevirts.com/\nClick show more to learn about the video, deck, music and moves!\n\nA note from The Virts about RISE:\n\nIf there‚Äôs one thing we‚Äôve learned from shuffling cards over the past 14 years, it‚Äôs that you only get better at Cardistry as you repeatedly push yourself beyond your limits. The byproduct of that, of course, is dropping cards - again, and again, and again.\n\nToday, after 14 years... we still drop our cards all the time. Sure, we now drop our cards less frequently; but no matter how much better we‚Äôve gotten, bending to the floor and repeatedly picking cards up covered in dust (and hair) never gets any less frustrating. \n\nOver the years, we‚Äôve come to establish a bit of a love-hate relationship with failure. We still don‚Äôt like it, yet we‚Äôve also come to recognize that if we‚Äôre not dropping our cards enough, we‚Äôre also not going to get any better at Cardistry. And in that sense, we‚Äôve come to find failure rather beautiful. \n\nRISE was birthed from a vision of ours to capture this intriguing beauty of failure.\n\nEnvisioning a juxtaposition between clean forms and abstract swirls, we pictured cards being manipulated with impeccable technique - abruptly interrupted and exploding out of the very hands that shuffled them. \n\nWe imagined them rising from the ground; the cards fluttering through the air in slow motion, dancing like the leaves in the Fall... and returning to our hands - perhaps forming imperfectly at first, then progressing with each step taken, and finally, displayed in all their glory. \n\nYet our stubbornness as Cardists doubling as filmmakers resulted in a few interesting restrictions that we imposed upon ourselves: \n\nIf this ‚ÄúFall‚Äù vision were to be captured, it would have to be done with no CG. Everything had to be filmed in-camera and performed by ourselves with with a real deck of cards.\n\nNext, there would be no use of green screen, compositing, or other camera trickery. The furthest we agreed upon was the reversal of several scenes - and only if they genuinely added to the story we wanted to tell. \n\nAnd finally, the cards used could not be gimmicked in anyway - no strings, magnets or anything of the sort. If what we envisioned could not be accomplished by our technique, then the idea was scrapped. \n\nThankfully, after months of planning, testing, and of course...failing, we finally had the opportunity to transform our vision into a reality. \n\nThrough the use of a Phantom high-speed camera mounted on a Bolt Cinebot (thank you Shooting Gallery Asia), and the help of a leaf blower or two... Rise was born. \n\nWe truly hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it for you. \n\n- The Virts\n\n---\n\nRISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck\nCredits:\nhttps://youtu.be/S7kG641iA_g\n\nCardistry Credits:\nCardistry performed by Virtuoso (The Virts):\nHuron Low \nKevin Ho \nDaren Yeow\n\nCardistry and Card flourish move list (in order shown):\n \nIndice Fans (classic)\nAnaconda by Bone Ho\nStairmaster by Kevin Ho (credit to Birger Karlsson and Kenneth Aidan Foo)\nNinja Spring Grab + Replacement by Virtuoso\nFlicker by Huron Low  + Rev 2 Twirl by Daren Yeow\nFlicker Shot Behind the Back by Huron Low\nV Cascade by Daren Yeow\nAerial Combo Sequence by Huron Low (Kick Cut Flip, V Flip, by Huron Low, Railslide Flip, Aerial Cut by Dan and Dave Buck)\nBuzzsaw by Brendan Conner\nAnaconda by Bone Ho\nMind Eraser by Kevin Ho (credit to Chris Kenner and Huron Low)\nSatellite by Kevin Ho\nTornado Deck Split by Kevin Ho (credit to Bone Ho)\nPiano Cuts by Andrew Avila\nYo! variation by Daren Yeow (credit to Lee Asher)\nWaterwheel by Huron Low, Daren Yeow, and Elijah Cai\nIndice Fans (classic)\n\nVideo credits:\nDirector: Huron Low of Virtuoso\nDirector of Photography: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nVideo Editor: Daren Yeow of Virtuoso\nLighting by: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nColor Grading by: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nCrew: The Shooting Gallery Asia\nWardrobe Styling by: Shu Juang\n\nMusic Credits:\nMusic: Rise by Virtuoso \nMusic composed and produced by: Roland Lim of Virtuoso\nAudio Post and Sound Design by: Roland Lim of Virtuoso\nAudio samples from Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins \n\nSpecial Thanks to:\nThe Shooting Gallery Asia: Seb Tan and his amazing team (shout out to Ahmad Rafa'ie!) for making this #Cardistry shoot possible. \nhttps://www.shootinggalleryasia.com/\n\nRISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck by #thevirts\nhttps://youtu.be/S7kG641iA_g\n\nThe new FW17 Virtuoso deck is launching soon. \nLearn more about this deck and Cardistry at https://thevirts.com/"

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù stars Tye Sheridan (‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse,‚Äù ‚ÄúMud‚Äù), Olivia Cooke (‚ÄúMe and Earl and the Dying Girl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBates Motel‚Äù), Ben Mendelsohn (‚ÄúRogue One ‚Äì A Star Wars Story,‚Äù ‚ÄúBloodline‚Äù) and T.J.

IC_lnyn2R2Q,THE 15:17 TO PARIS - Official Trailer [HD],"From Clint Eastwood comes The 15:17 to Paris - in theaters February 9.\n\nhttp://www.1517toparis.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/1517toparis\nhttps://twitter.com/1517toParis\nhttps://www.instagram.com/1517toparis\n\n--\n\nFrom Clint Eastwood comes ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris,‚Äù which tells the real-life story of three men whose brave act turned them into heroes during a highspeed railway ride.\n\nIn the early evening of August 21, 2015, the world watched in stunned silence as the media reported a thwarted terrorist attack on Thalys train #9364 bound for Paris‚Äîan attempt prevented by three courageous young Americans traveling through Europe.  The film follows the course of the friends‚Äô lives, from the struggles of childhood through finding their footing in life, to the series of unlikely events leading up to the attack.  Throughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.\n\nThe heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.  Starring alongside them are Jenna Fischer (‚ÄúHall Pass,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù); Judy Greer (‚ÄúWar for the Planet of the Apes‚Äù); Ray Corasani (TV‚Äôs upcoming ‚ÄúThe Long Road Home‚Äù); PJ Byrne (‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street‚Äù); Tony Hale (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúVeep‚Äù); and Thomas Lennon (‚ÄúTransformers: Age of Extinction‚Äù).  Paul-Mik√©l Williams plays the younger Anthony, Bryce Gheisar plays the younger Alek, and William Jennings plays the younger Spencer.\n\nEastwood (‚ÄúSully,‚Äù ‚ÄúAmerican Sniper‚Äù) directs from a screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the book by Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Jeffrey E. Stern.  Eastwood also produces the film, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier.  The film‚Äôs executive producer is Bruce Berman.\n\nBehind the scenes, the creative team includes frequent collaborators Tom Stern, who served as cinematographer on 13 of Eastwood‚Äôs previous films, and Deborah Hopper, who has served as Eastwood‚Äôs costume designer on 17 prior films; editor Blu Murray, who most recently cut ‚ÄúSully,‚Äù and that film‚Äôs composer, Christian Jacob.  Veteran art director Kevin Ishioka, whose work can be seen in ‚ÄúSully‚Äù and in ‚ÄúDunkirk,‚Äù serves as production designer.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Malpaso production, ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris.‚Äù  The film will be released in theaters on February 9, 2018.  It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures."

Buy one of the season‚Äôs hottest Samsung Galaxy smartphones, get a second one free to gift. Only at T-Mobile.http://bit.ly/2iZDff8\nMore Celebrity News ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nThe show that‚Äôs had us all obsessed for over a year and a half now has a possibly concerning new update. In an interview with Variety at the Dubai International Film Festival, David Harbour ‚Äì aka Chief Jim Hopper ‚Äì revealed that the third season of the hit sci-fi series probably won‚Äôt hit Netflix until 2019! It‚Äôs not even 2018 now. That means we might have to wait more than a year to get the goods of season 3.\n\nAs soon as those words came out of his mouth the internet went into a frenzy, with fans around the globe tweeting angry gifs with the text ‚ÄúWhen you realize you have to wait until 2013 for season 3 of stranger things.‚Äù Now, the good news is that while we impatiently wait, the Duffer brothers responsible for those amazing scripts are working hard to create an unforgettable third season. \n\nChief Hopper even revealed that the writers basically just sit in their apartments day in and day out for like 12-14 hours a day and just WRITE. And we thank you for your service. On another note, the weekend that Stranger Things was released gave Netflix its biggest streaming day in the UK in all of 2017. By Sunday, October 29th, many fans had literally binged the entire second season in under 24 hours. \n\nLet‚Äôs learn our lesson and take our time in season 3. But I want to hear from you: how you feeling that we might have to wait like a thousand years for the next season. Between the wait time for Game of Thrones and now Stranger Things, I might just give up on TV altogether. It‚Äôs becoming so cruel! Anyway, share your thoughts below on what your predictions for season 3 are and your favorite show you‚Äôre currently waiting on. I‚Äôm your girl Miriam Isa, thank you so much for all your follows on my Twitter and Instagram.

1UPJ_Uk9s5c,Black Panther: New International Trailer Released - Movie Talk,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday December 12th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff, Jared Haibon, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) Hugh Jackman rules out a return as Wolverine if Disney/Fox merger happens; Disney/Fox deal nears finish line as Comcast withdraws\n\n2) ‚ÄòCreed 2‚Äô Lands Director Steven Caple Jr.; Stallone Sits Out This Round\n\n3) Opening This Week ‚Äì Star Wars the Last Jedi \n\n4) Seth Rogen to Go Dramatic as Walter Cronkite in JFK Assassination Film ‚ÄòNewsflash‚Äô\n\n5) ‚ÄòBlack Panther‚Äô: New International Trailer Released Online \n\n6) Mail Bag \n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nVariety has updated the status of the proposed Disney/Fox merger and is now reporting that the Mouse House has such an inside track on a $60 billion-plus agreement that Comcast has formally exited the deal. While implications for the merger remain foggy, one thing most fans want to see is the Fantastic Four and the X-Men return to the MCU ‚Äì and especially ‚Äì if it‚Äôs enough to lure Hugh Jackman out of retirement. \n\nVariety reports that MGM and Warner Bros. have hired up-and-coming director Steven Caple Jr. to direct Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson in Creed 2. It was previously reported that Stallone had considered directing sequel at one point, but after talking it over with Jordan and the execs, made the decision to find another director and after a lengthy search, both Jordan and Stallone personally picked Caple to take the reins. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nDeadline reports that Seth Rogen has signed on to play legendary CBS newsman Walter Cronkite in the upcoming drama Newsflash, directed by his Pineapple Express director David Gordon Green. The drama takes place on November 22, 1963, the day of President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs assassination, unfolding in real time as Cronkite and his producer Don Hewitt attempt to report on one of the biggest news stories in history. \n\nA new international trailer from Japan has landed online for Black Panther and it features even more unseen footage of the advanced weaponry utilized by the people of Wakanda. The movie stars Chadwick Boseman as T‚ÄôChalla, who must stand against a powerful old enemy who reappears after years hidden in order to defend the throne and save his people. Black Panther is the next entry in the MCU and opens in theaters on February 16, 2018.\n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Jared: https://twitter.com/haibon_jared\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

I wanted to advertise to ppl who wouldn't know about this mental health problem already. u know\nan amazing podcast on this! http://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.j745\nmore info: https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/dissociative-disorders/#.WjHC7lSFjR0\n\nmy book! http://secretsforthemadbook.com\n\nhttp://youtube.com/doddleoddle\nhttp://youtube.com/dodievevo for music\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/doddleoddle\nsnapchat and instagram username is doddleoddle\n\nmy EPs are called Intertwined and You - on Spotify and iTunes :)\n\nBUSINESS EMAIL: info@dodieclark.com\n\n\nMORE TIPS\nokay spaced out pals. here's the thing. everyone's telling us to just ignore it and that is SO ANNOYING TO HEAR because it's like\nif you had a chronic pain in your arm and people tell you to ignore it it's like i LITERALLY CAN'T because it's SO OBVIOUS.\nbut the way to function with this is to pretend it doesn't bother you - over time your thinking patterns will change and though you will still be spaced out, it won't make you as depressed/anxious because it will just be something you have and that's it.\n\nYes, it sucks to think about that. DON'T GIVE UP HOPE - more research will be done, there are other options you haven't tried yet, you will feel present again one day - but just in case that day doesn't come/it takes a while, you might as well enjoy life as best as you can whilst feeling spaced out!\n\nLast year I could barely talk to people I was that spaced out! I didn't want to leave my flat for fear my existence would be snuffed out it felt so fragile. But now I wake up and although I still am living in this weird dreamlike world, I can function and make an impression on the world, despite barely feeling like I'm in it.\n\nIt will be okay! I Promise! Don't give up hope! Practise loving what you can experience!\n\nxxxx"

XXXqaYls50o,Riverdale | Chapter Twenty-Three: The Blackboard Jungle Trailer | The CW,"Riverdale is new Wednesdays at 8/7c only on The CW, and available next day on The CW App: http://go.cwtv.com/genRVRyt\n \nSUBSCRIBE: http://go.cwtv.com/YTSubscribe\n \nAbout RIVERDALE:\nAs a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom ‚Äî and nothing feels the same. Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer‚Äôs events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale‚Äôs young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It‚Äôs all weighing heavily on Archie‚Äôs mind ‚Äî as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she‚Äôs not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty‚Äôs nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (M√§dchen Amick), aren‚Äôt the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there‚Äôs an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn‚Äôt want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there‚Äôs Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale‚Äôs Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own.

On the Season Four premiere, Lucious makes his first public appearance after the explosion in Las Vegas, while all members of the Lyon family have their own interests in Lucious regaining his physical and mental faculties. Academy Award- and Golden Globe-winning actor, director and producer Forest Whitaker (‚ÄúThe Last King of Scotland,‚Äù ‚ÄúArrival,‚Äù ‚ÄúLee Daniels‚Äô The Butler‚Äù) will guest-star in a multi-episode arc on EMPIRE, beginning this fall on FOX. Whitaker will play ‚ÄúUncle Eddie,‚Äù a charismatic music icon and bonafide hitmaker, who gave an unknown Lucious (Terrence Howard) his first radio airplay. Decades later, Eddie steps up for Lucious at a critical moment during his rehabilitation, and a grateful Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) invites him to produce a song in celebration of Empire Entertainment‚Äôs 20th anniversary.\n\nEMPIRE is a powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and sometimes dangerous world of hip-hop music. The show revolves around the Lyon family and their media company, Empire Entertainment. The founder, LUCIOUS LYON (Terrence Howard), is the king of hip-hop, but his company and reign are constantly threatened by his family, including his ex-wife, COOKIE LYON (Taraji P. Henson); his sons, JAMAL (Jussie Smollett), HAKEEM (Bryshere ‚ÄúYazz‚Äù Gray) and ANDRE (Trai Byers); and a volatile and competitive music industry.\n\n‚ÄúSanta Baby‚Äù ft.

v_5qKt7M5fM,Star Wars The Last Jedi Scores An A Cinemascore And 2nd Largest Opening Ever - The John Campea Show,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Satruday, December 16th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nRT - My question is on how Netflix makes money on their original shows. Do people really subscribe because of Stranger Things or Punisher and will anyone drop out when it's over?  I didn't and I won't. Thanks for taking my question. \n\nPATREON Supporter Ali Hussein - Hi John greeting from Sweden love your show. My question is: Now that fox Disney deal is done. When do you think Disney/Marvel going to announced the new cast for X-Men. Do you think before 2020 or after. Love do hear your thoughts.\n\nJoshua Martin - With Disney's recent acquisition of Fox properties, namely the X-men/Deadpool and F4, does this give Disney/Marvel more power or leverage to either 1. Renegotiate their deal with Sony (after homecoming 2) to allow more Spiderman characters into the MCU at their control (or simply buy them) or 2. Buy back the rights to Hulk and Namor from Universal?\n\nRene Bernard - Hey John. CNN reported that Star Wars: The Last Jedi became the second largest opening Thursday night movie in history with $45 million dollars. With those numbers, do you still think it won‚Äôt catch The Force Awakens opening weekend box office record?"

BBQ-2BUGQv8,Star Wars: The Last Jedi Has Second Largest Opening Ever Amidst Mixed Fan Reactions - Movie Talk,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Monday December 18th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) Star Wars: The Last Jedi' Delivers Second Largest Opening Ever; Fans Split on Rotten Tomatoes\n\n2) Box Office Report\n\n3) Oscar Isaac in Talks to Voice Gomez Addams in Animated ‚ÄòAddams Family‚Äô Movie\n\n4) '48 Hrs.' Remake in the Works With 'Good Time' Filmmakers\n\n5) ‚ÄòLaddie‚Äô Trailer: Meet The Man Who Made ‚ÄòStar Wars‚Äô Possible\n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi delivered on expectations, debuting over the weekend with the second largest opening of all-time, behind only Star Wars The Force Awakens. With an estimated $220 million, The Last Jedi got off to a strong start on Thursday night with the second largest preview ever with $45 million and became the second film to ever gross over $100 million on opening day. Audiences also gave the film an A CinemaScore, matching the score for Force Awakens, however; the Rotten Tomatoes audience score for Last Jedi is currently 56% vs. a 93% score from critics ‚Äì with an increasing backlash happening online between those fans who enjoyed the movie and those who did not.  \n\nBOX OFFICE REPORT\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nAccording to a report from The Tracking Board, Oscar Isaac has been cast as the voice of Gomez Addams in the animated The Addams Family movie for Sausage Party director Conrad Vernan. The roles of Morticia, Wednesday, Pugsley, Lurch and Uncle Fester have yet to be filled, apparently because the studio wants to close a deal with Isaac before approaching anyone else.\n\nTHR reports that Benny and Josh Safdie, the brother filmmaking team behind the Robert Pattinson thriller Good Time, will take on a remake of 48 Hrs. for Paramount Pictures. 48 Hrs. is the classic comedy that helped launch the big-screen career of Eddie Murphy, as well as the buddy-cop genre. Murphy and Nick Nolte starred as a convict and cop, who must team up to catch a pair of killers within 48 hours. A release date has not been determined. \n\nStar Wars Underworld found and posted the first trailer for ‚ÄòLaddie,‚Äù the documentary about Alan Ladd Jr, AKA Laddie, the man at 20th Century Fox who gave George Lucas the greenlight and freedom to make Star Wars back in 1977.  The documentary dives into Ladd as an agent, producer, executive, and studio head, where he worked on movies ranging from Alien to Young Frankenstein to Star Wars over the course of his long, storied career. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

It‚Äôs more fun getting involved with franchises when they‚Äôre on the down, because then it‚Äôs easier to make a good film.

Share this Christmas card with someone you love! üíï ‚ñ∫http://bit.ly/2BUEGVb\nThis project spells out Merry Christmas in 7,000 dominoes and incorporates various Christmas-related objects including ornaments, Santa, a mistletoe, and Christmas lights :)\n\nWatch my other Christmas domino specials here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn0dmj1AovU&list=PLNPDtUHUkSPb-IZVGtuQGkYM5L6aOkevw&index=1\n\nFor a while I've wanted to try building large fancy font freehanded out of dominoes, so I decided to build Merry Christmas in cursive :) I wanted to test my skills in recreating an image out of dominoes by eyeing it. Lettering is always a challenge to build in dominoes based off a picture because you have to be extremely precise to make the font look right (here's the original picture: http://bit.ly/2DylugC). Lots of proportions, measuring, and eye-balling were needed for this project. It was also a challenge to figure out how to get this to topple sequentially by letter, since everything was connected in cursive (however, sometimes not in the direction it needed to topple). I had to tape down a few one way dominoes to ensure that the path would keep going in the right direction. Overall, this was a fun project to do and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed building it :)\n\nWATCH MORE DOMINO VIDEOS HERE! üòä\n‚óèYOUTUBERS in dominoes ‚û°Ô∏è http://bit.ly/2uRzTDf\n‚óèMy BEST domino projects ‚û°Ô∏è http://bit.ly/2swnIWN\n‚óèVideo games/movies in dominoes ‚û°Ô∏è http://bit.ly/2u8tZdx\n\nHey!

lxSWRdgD4Ho,Alien Covenant Sequel Cancelled?

You have talked before about how Netflix won't be hurt to much by Disney taking it's properties off Netflix. But with the Disney/Fox deal it's safe to assume that a similar thing will happen with all the newly acquired Fox properties. Two major company taking content off Netflix is a lot more significant than if just one did. \n\nMelissa Ramirez  - Looks like the sequel to Alien Covenent got cancelled just like you said it would. But really, is it any surprise? The last film did so badly, why did anyone still think a new one would happen?\n\nJacob Hickey - The box office results of Blade Runner 2019 has to rank amongst the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2017. Such a great movie, such a sad result. Ridley Scott is saying that the reason is did badly was the long running time. Do you agree with him?\n\nDion Debord - Hey John. Hope you‚Äôre having a great holiday season! With the debate going on about The Last Jedi, Mark Hamill has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the film. My question is, even if all film is subjective, if Luke Skywalker himself says the movie isn‚Äôt good, how can anyone still defend it?\n\nIntothefuture - Q: I have been looking forward to the Han Solo film coming out sometime i‚Äôm 2018. I thought with Ron Howard coming in that all would be forgiven and or saved? Do you think this movie has a chance? Reports are saying Disney has no faith. This is not good to hear :("

Equal parts family history, dynastic saga and an examination of the corrosive power of money, Trust explores the complexities at the heart of every family, rich or poor.  \n\nTold over multiple seasons and spanning the twentieth century, the series begins in 1973 with the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Harris Dickinson), an heir to the Getty oil fortune, by the Italian mafia in Rome. His captors banked on a multi-million-dollar ransom. After all, what rich family wouldn‚Äôt pay for the return of a loved one? \nPaul‚Äôs grandfather, J. Paul Getty (Donald Sutherland), an enigmatic oil tycoon and possibly the richest man in the world, is marooned in a Tudor mansion in the English countryside surrounded by a harem of mistresses and a pet lion. He‚Äôs busy. Paul‚Äôs father, J. Paul Getty Jr. (Michael Esper), is lost in a daze in London and refuses to answer the phone. Only Paul‚Äôs mother, Gail Getty (Hilary Swank), is left to negotiate with the increasingly desperate kidnappers. Unfortunately, she‚Äôs broke. Trust charts the teenage grandson‚Äôs nightmare ordeal at the hands of kidnappers who cannot understand why nobody seems to want their captive back.\n\nThe cast also includes Brendan Fraser, Anna Chancellor, Norbert Leo Butz, Charlotte Riley and Luca Marinelli.\n\nTrust is created by Simon Beaufoy. Danny Boyle has directed the first three episodes. Executive Producers are Christian Colson, Beaufoy and Boyle.

WmYCUljsrDg,Log Cabin TIMELAPSE Built By ONE MAN In The Forest (Real Life Minecraft),"Timelapse video of a complete log cabin build by one man alone in the wilderness of Canada, from 1st tree I cut to last floor board I laid. If you want to build a rustic log cabin or tiny off grid home alone in the wilderness and you haven't seen the rest of my videos, this is a good primer. It's super fast motion though, so if you are interested in building a primitive log cabin like this, take a look at the Log Cabin The Bear Den playlist on the channel.\nAt the beginning of the video, I show a winter drone photo of the cabin in the snow in December. Then I flashback to the first balsam fir tree I cut down with a saw and axe near the cabin. I drag the trees into place and clear the cabin site. All summer, I cut the notches in the logs as I built the cabin up, offsite. Once I was finished notching the logs with a log scribe, saw, axe, adze and wood carving gouge, I loaded up the entire cabin of logs and moved them to my land near Algonquin Park, Ontario Canada.\nOnce on site, I spent a month reassembling the cabin on a foundation of sand and gravel. Once the log walls were up, I again used hand tools to shape every log, board and timber to erect the gable ends, the wood roof, the porch, the outhouse and a seemingly endless number of woodworking projects.\nFor the roof, I used an ancient primitive technology to waterproof and preserve the wood - shou sugi ban, a fire hardening wood preservation technique unique to Japan and other areas in northern climates.\nBecause the cabin is offgrid, I have used handtools for most of the build and without power, I have no options on site regardless. The tiny house will continue to be operated with power, not even renewable energy for now, so I'm heating the cabin with a woodstove fire place, which I also cook on.\nThe cabin is made of cedar fence posts, twelve feet long and the cabin measures 10 feet x 20 feet inside with a one hundred square foot sleeping loft on the second floor.\nThe floor is made of two inch thick pine planks, torched to help repel water and to give them a rustic barn board appearance.\n\nTune off sound if you don't want to hear the music, - there is no talking in this silent video. If you are a subscriber or long time viewer, there is some new footage at the end of the video, but otherwise you have seen most of this. As always, I'll release a new video on Friday showing the progress I made this week on the door and the ice box for food storage.\n\nTo see what I‚Äôm up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram ‚Äì https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMusic \nEternal Hope by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100238\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/"

8bqvu8eFZss,FULL STREAM | Yerry Mina's unveiling as a Bar√ßa player,"Presentaci√≥n en directo de Yerry MIna como nuevo jugador del FC Barcelona, desde el Camp Nou.\nLa de este s√°bado en el Camp Nou ha sido una presentaci√≥n at√≠pica. No es habitual que un nuevo jugador del FC Barcelona conecte tan pronto con la afici√≥n como lo ha hecho Yerry Mina. El defensa ha reunido a un total de 8.552 espectadores en el Camp Nou, muchos de ellos aficionados colombianos que ya conoc√≠an al futbolista desde sus inicios en Deportivo Pasto e Independiente Santa Fe. En las gradas ha habido m√∫sica, bailes y mucha fiesta.\n\nLa presentaci√≥n ha tenido de todo. Ha arrancado con Yerry Mina descalz√°ndose los zapatos y las medias en un ritual habitual en √©l antes de pisar el c√©sped y llevar a cabo los habituales toques de bal√≥n. Era la primera vez que el central luc√≠a la que ser√° su nueva equipaci√≥n a partir de ahora, y ha dejado clara su felicidad con un grito apasionado: ¬°Vamos, Bar√ßa! Visca, Bar√ßa!.\n\nA continuaci√≥n, el jugador ha posado para los medios de comunicaci√≥n -se han acreditado 103 periodistas, 25 de ellos colombianos, de un total de 70 medios diferentes- y ha completado un rondo con j√≥venes jugadores de la cantera. Despu√©s el futbolista ha recibido su coche AUDI.\n\nCon cualquier otro jugador la presentaci√≥n habr√≠a acabado segundos m√°s tarde. Pero Yerry Mina se ha acercado hasta el gol para saludar a toda la afici√≥n que lo ha venido a recibir. Y all√≠ ha dejado una peque√±a pincelada de uno de sus rasgos m√°s caracter√≠sticos: el baile de salsa 'choke' que suele llevar a cabo cada vez que marca un gol. Seguro que volveremos a ver este movimiento en un futuro."

3D_ZODCSKXo,Will the Flash Movie (Flashpoint) Be Too Comedic in Tone? - Movie Talk,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday, January 17th, 2018) Mark Ellis, Jay Washington, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff discuss the following:\n\n1) Flash‚Äô Standalone Film Taps Directors John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein\n\n2) First Official Synopsis for ‚ÄòSolo: A Star Wars Story‚Äô Teases an Eventful Adventure\n\n3) First Trailer for Gus Van Sant‚Äôs: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Worry, He Won‚Äôt Get Far on Foot‚Äô starring Joaquin Phoenix, Jack Black and Jonah Hill\n\n4) New ‚ÄòAnt-Man and the Wasp‚Äô Image Shows Off the Title Team, All Suited Up\n\n5) New trailer released for Love, Simon\n\n6) Mail Bag \n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nVariety is reporting that the Vacation helmers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein are in negotiations to direct Flashpoint, the Flash‚Äôs standalone feature starring Ezra Miller. Interestingly enough, the studio initially asked Ben Affleck to return to the director‚Äôs chair, but he eventually passed. This comes as Warner Bros. begins reshuffling its D.C. properties, with New Line exec Walter Hamada recently promoted to oversee its comic book movies. \n\nDisney has released the first official synopsis for Solo: A Star Wars Story, the major new Star Wars movie that‚Äôs coming out in a little over four months. As part of Disney‚Äôs 2018 preview kit, the synopsis seems to tease the release of the first trailer, which should be coming any day now.\n\nAGREE OR DISAGREE\n\nAmazon Studios has released the first trailer for Don‚Äôt Worry, He Won‚Äôt Get Far on Foot. Written and directed by Gus Van Sant, the film is based on the memoir of the same name by cartoonist, artist, and musician John Callahan. Joaquin Phoenix plays Callahan, who becomes a quadriplegic in a car accident at the age of 21 after a day of drinking. \n\nYesterday, Disney released its 2018 preview kit teasing their upcoming slate of films and inside featured the first official look at Hope Van Dyne alongside Scott Lang in Marvel‚Äôs upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reprise their roles in the movie alongside Michael Pe√±a and Michael Douglas, that will also introduce Hope‚Äôs mother, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. \n\n20th Century Fox has released a new trailer for Love, Simon. Based on Becky Albertalli‚Äôs novel, Greg Berlanti‚Äôs film follows seventeen-year-old Simon Spier (Nick Robinson), who is currently grappling with how to tell his family and friends that he‚Äôs gay while also working to identify an anonymous classmate he‚Äôs fallen for online. The film is set for release on March 16th. \n\nMAIL BAG \n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Jay: https://twitter.com/MrJayWashington\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

iLZSB-5Dyf8,READY PLAYER ONE - See The Future,"http://readyplayeronemovie.com\nhttp://facebook.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://twitter.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://instagram.com/readyplayerone\n\n-- \n\nFrom filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the science fiction action adventure ‚ÄúReady Player One,‚Äù based on Ernest Cline‚Äôs bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon.  \n\nThe film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù stars Tye Sheridan (‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse,‚Äù ‚ÄúMud‚Äù), Olivia Cooke (‚ÄúMe and Earl and the Dying Girl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBates Motel‚Äù), Ben Mendelsohn (‚ÄúRogue One ‚Äì A Star Wars Story,‚Äù ‚ÄúBloodline‚Äù) and T.J. Miller (‚ÄúDeadpool,‚Äù ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù), with Simon Pegg (the ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù movies, the ‚ÄúMission: Impossible‚Äù movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (‚ÄúBridge of Spies,‚Äù ‚ÄúDunkirk‚Äù).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan‚Äù) reunited his creative team from ‚ÄúBridge of Spies,‚Äù including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan‚Äù), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (‚ÄúThe Grand Budapest Hotel‚Äù), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan,‚Äù ‚ÄúRaiders of the Lost Ark‚Äù) and Sarah Broshar (‚ÄúThe Post‚Äù), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (‚ÄúMoonrise Kingdom‚Äù).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù films, ‚ÄúForrest Gump‚Äù).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, ‚ÄúReady Player One.‚Äù\n\nSlated for release on March 30, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures."

JrFiNSueT3Y,10 BEST Moments From 2018 SAG Awards,"More Celebrity News ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nFirst and foremost, our hats go off to Mr. Morgan Freeman also known as the man I hope to narrate my life story one day. He was honored tonight with the Lifetime Achievement Award. \nMorgan‚Äôs good friend, Rita Moreno presented him with the prestigious award and the display of their friendship was beyond adorable. Morgan was sure to thank her along with his family and friends who flew out to celebrate with him as well as his peers in the room. Then Morgan took a moment to point out the fact that the SAG award statue, known as the Actor has a bit of a bias to it. \nYou gotta love Morgan Freeman. Another person you can‚Äôt help but to love is Sterling K. Brown. He won best male actor in a drama series for his role on This Is Us making history once again becoming the first black man to win in that category. \nSterling also thanked his peers in the room and his beautiful wife who had the sweetest most adorable reaction to his winning streak continuing.  \nWhen the camera panned to Ryan‚Äôs face while Sterling was giving his speech, she was literally shaking with pride and happiness. \nWhich brings me to yet another moving moment during the show. Nicole Kidman won her first SAG award tonight for best Female Actor in a television Movie or Limited Series for her work  in Big Little Lies. She got choked up noting that winning means so much to her because she has been acting since she was 14 years old. \nShe went on to thank her co-stars, fellow nominees and female actors who have inspired her and paved the way for her career. \nShe continued saying - We've proven ‚Äî and these actresses and so many more have proven ‚Äî we are potent and powerful and viable. I just beg that the industry stays behind us because our stories are finally being told. It's only the beginning.\n\n\nFor More Clevver Visit:\nThere are 2 types of people: those who follow us on Facebook and those who are missing out http://facebook.com/clevver\n\nKeep up with us on Instagram: http://instagr.am/Clevver\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ClevverTV\nWebsite: http://www.clevver.com \n\n\nAdd us to your circles on Google+: http://google.com/+ClevverNews\nTweet Me: http://www.twitter.com/Drew__dorsey"

db9Shsd8q8M,Childish Gambino Gives SOULFUL Terrified Performance At 2018 Grammys,"More Celebrity News ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nAlong with many other talented artists, Childish Gambino performed tonight at this year‚Äôs Grammy Awards and absolutely killed it. It was actually his first ever time performing at the annual awards ceremony and let‚Äôs just say he did not disappoint. Looking handsome as ever in an all white suit, he absolutely crushed the performance of his stand-alone track ‚ÄòTerrified,‚Äô off his nominated album ‚ÄòAwaken, My Love.‚Äô\nNot only did he melt our hearts with that voice, he then completely surprised us by bringing JD McCrary up on stage to sing with him. Who, also sung like an actual angel.\nTonight felt like a preview of what‚Äôs to come, since Donald Glover and JD will actually be starring in a movie together, as they both are set to be in the Live-Action Lion King film.  JD will be voicing Young Simba and Donald will be voicing older Simba. And after this performance, we completely understand the casting choice.  \nThis was definitely a big night for Childish Gambino. In case that performance wasn‚Äôt enough, his track ‚ÄòRedbone‚Äô just won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance.\nBut right now I wanna turn it over to you guys. What did you think of Childish Gambino‚Äôs performance? Let me know all your thoughts and feelings down in the comments below and when you‚Äôre done with that, click right over here for all the deets on Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs performance.

Next Independence Day, witness the rise of our country‚Äôs 12 hours of annual lawlessness.  Welcome to the movement that began as a simple experiment: The First Purge.\n \nTo push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community.  But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the marginalized, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.\n\nComing off the most successful film in the series, The Purge: Election Year, creator James DeMonaco (writer/director of The Purge, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year) returns alongside the producers of this worldwide phenomenon: Blumhouse Productions‚Äô Jason Blum (Insidious series, Get Out, Split), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and DeMonaco‚Äôs longtime production partner, S√©bastien K. Lemercier (Assault on Precinct 13, Four Lovers).  \n\nThe First Purge is directed by Gerard McMurray (Burning Sands), working from a screenplay once again written by DeMonaco.  www.thefirstpurge.com"

jjRXuZkeGRA,Riverdale | Chapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart Trailer | The CW,"Riverdale is new Wednesdays at 8/7c only on The CW, and available next day on The CW App: http://go.cwtv.com/genRVRyt\n \nSUBSCRIBE: http://go.cwtv.com/YTSubscribe\n \nAbout RIVERDALE:\nAs a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom ‚Äî and nothing feels the same. Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer‚Äôs events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale‚Äôs young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It‚Äôs all weighing heavily on Archie‚Äôs mind ‚Äî as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she‚Äôs not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty‚Äôs nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (M√§dchen Amick), aren‚Äôt the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there‚Äôs an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn‚Äôt want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there‚Äôs Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale‚Äôs Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, RIVERDALE is from Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúGlee‚Äù), Greg Berlanti (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù), Sarah Schechter (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù) and Jon Goldwater (Archie Comics).\n\nConnect with RIVERDALE Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE : http://cwtv.com/shows/riverdale\nLike RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/CWRiverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CW_Riverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thecwriverdale/\n\nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as Black Lightning, Life Sentence, The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Dynasty, and Valor.\n\nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nRiverdale | Chapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart Trailer | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision"

Hmb0Q0Q_7jo,The blue marble,"After 3 months of work and probably more than 500 fails, I'm happy to present you my best video ever. \nSince magnets and marbles I've always wanted to make a big chain reaction in one take with this 2D style ! \n\nIt's also a one marble path which means you have to follow the same marble for all the tricks (in that case the little blue one.) Because everything is in a tilted plane, the hard part was to find different ways of having the marble riding up along the table (magnets, falling weight, catapult ...). To do that, the marble has to be light. And because everything has to be triggered by this little marble, all the tricks are very unstable. Most fails happened when an element fall down earlier than expected.\n\nI learned a lot about chain reaction, and I discovered the amazing power of the hot glue gun !"

Eggert responds, 14-years-old, 1986 and before I was 15-years-old, he had me at his home, in his car, in his garage and he penetrated my vagina with his finger and this is where it began and this continued almost on a weekly basis for years. Of course, the abuse progressed from there quite a bit although I remained a virgin until I was 17.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

v3O9vNi-dkA,Hear the Otherworldly Sounds of Skating on Thin Ice | National Geographic,"This small lake outside Stockholm, Sweden, emits otherworldly sounds as M√•rten Ajne skates over its precariously thin, black ice. ‚ÄúWild ice skating,‚Äù or ‚ÄúNordic skating,‚Äù is both an art and a science. A skater seeks out the thinnest, most pristine black ice possible‚Äîboth for its smoothness, and for its high-pitched, laser-like sounds. \n‚û° Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Like a dome or arch, the support comes from the sides rather than the top, and the water underneath prevents the ice from breaking. But, experience and careful advance planning are key. Factors including temperature, atmospheric conditions, and even satellite images of the Earth‚Äôs surface are considered. It‚Äôs complicated, but appealing to mathematicians like Ajne. Even with preparation, there‚Äôs a risk of falling in‚Ä¶ So it‚Äôs best done in groups, for safety.\n\nRead about the science behind Nordic skating in How Skating on Thin Ice Creates Laser-Like Sounds\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/activities/winter-sports/skating-thin-black-ice-creates-sound-nordic-spd/\n\nHear the Otherworldly Sounds of Skating on Thin Ice | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/v3O9vNi-dkA\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

dAfqL3Hts_U,How Much Will Black Panther Boost Avengers Infinity War Box Office,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Monday, February 19th 2018) John discusses the following viewer submitted topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nTyler Roberts - With Black Panther smashing this weekend i think Infinity War is going to get dangerously close to beating the force awakens opening. People are also underestimating The Guardians of the Galaxy and the pop that will bring to IW since a lot of people didn‚Äôt know they are even apart of the avengers. Thoughts?\n\nRaymundo Lopez - Black Panther is now the MCU‚Äôs highest opening weekend for a stand alone movie. Do you think this gives confidence to Marvel that the MCU can survive and thrive once the original cast leaves? Do you also think this puts to rest the talks that the MCU needs to reboot after Thanos?\n\nJosh DeRose - After numerous false starts, it appears as though NBC might finally be moving forward with a companion series for The Office. Assuming John Krasinski reprises his role, do you believe the show will live up to fan expectations?"

As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy.

vjnqABgxfO0,The Grinch - Official Trailer (HD),"The Grinch - Official Trailer\nIn Theaters November 9\nhttps://www.grinchmovie.com\n\n\nFor their eighth fully animated feature, Illumination and Universal Pictures present The Grinch, based on Dr. Seuss‚Äô beloved holiday classic.  The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl‚Äôs generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it‚Äôs a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award¬Æ nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who‚Äîa young girl overflowing with holiday cheer‚Äîplots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch‚Äôs more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos‚Äô holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018."

Pictures‚Äô ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald‚Äù is the second of five all new adventures in J.K. Rowling‚Äôs Wizarding World‚Ñ¢.  \n\nAt the end of the first film, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne).  But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings.  \n\nIn an effort to thwart Grindelwald‚Äôs plans, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead.  Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.  \n\nThe film features an ensemble cast led by Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, with Jude Law and Johnny Depp.  The cast also includes, Zo√´ Kravitz, Callum Turner, Claudia Kim, William Nadylam, Kevin Guthrie, Carmen Ejogo, and  Poppy Corby-Tuech.\n\n‚ÄúFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald‚Äù is directed by David Yates, from a screenplay by J.K. Rowling.  The film is produced by David Heyman, J.K. Rowling, Steve Kloves and Lionel Wigram.  \n\nSlated for release on November 16, 2018, the film will be distributed worldwide in 2D and 3D in select theatres and IMAX by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company."

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends. Now, they will fight for the human race.\n \nConnect with THE 100 Online:\nVisit THE 100 WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/The100\nLike THE 100 on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/cwthe100\nFollow THE 100 on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/cwthe100\nFollow THE 100 on INSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/cw_the100\nFollow THE 100 on TUMBLR: http://cwthe100.tumblr.com\nFollow THE 100 on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw/the-100\n \nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as Black Lightning, Life Sentence, The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Dynasty, and Valor.\n \nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nThe 100 | Season 5 Official Extended Trailer | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision"

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù stars Tye Sheridan (‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse,‚Äù ‚ÄúMud‚Äù), Olivia Cooke (‚ÄúMe and Earl and the Dying Girl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBates Motel‚Äù), Ben Mendelsohn (‚ÄúRogue One ‚Äì A Star Wars Story,‚Äù ‚ÄúBloodline‚Äù) and T.J. Miller (‚ÄúDeadpool,‚Äù ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù), with Simon Pegg (the ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù movies, the ‚ÄúMission: Impossible‚Äù movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (‚ÄúBridge of Spies,‚Äù ‚ÄúDunkirk‚Äù).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan‚Äù) reunited his creative team from ‚ÄúBridge of Spies,‚Äù including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan‚Äù), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (‚ÄúThe Grand Budapest Hotel‚Äù), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan,‚Äù ‚ÄúRaiders of the Lost Ark‚Äù) and Sarah Broshar (‚ÄúThe Post‚Äù), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (‚ÄúMoonrise Kingdom‚Äù).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù films, ‚ÄúForrest Gump‚Äù).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, ‚ÄúReady Player One.‚Äù\n\nSlated for release on March 29, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros.

Zedd's self-decorated home is 9,500 square feet with views of the canyon and tons of full-length glass windows. \n\nThe house is structured into three sections: work, living, and sleep. The work section has Zedd's recording studio and an unfinished gym.\n\nThe driveway leads into the front entrance, which crosses a moat. \n\nA huge wall with cubbies holds art, awards, and silly memorabilia. For instance, Zedd's Grammy sits next to a poop emoji.\n\nAt the end of a corridor, before going outside, guests can pick their favorite flavor of the rainbow from the Skittles machine. \n\nZedd also has a server room and a Costco Room that contains just about anything he would need if he weren't able to leave the house for a long time.\n\nThe bathrooms feature automated blinds that can sometimes surprise the person taking the shower early in the morning.\n\nThe remote-controlled curtains in Zedd's bedroom make him the happiest of any feature in the house.\n\nOutside, the pool has a hidden jacuzzi / hot tub that's revealed when the pool's water level drops.\n\nThe kitchen has four built-in hibachi grills, a pot filler above the stovetop (which Zedd says is the reason he bought the house), and built-in vacuums.  \n\nStill haven‚Äôt subscribed to Architectural Digest on YouTube? ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/2zl7s34\n\nABOUT ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST\nThe leading international design authority, Architectural Digest features articles and videos of the best in architecture, style, culture, travel, and shopping.\n\nInside Zedd's $16 Million Mansion That Has a Skittles Machine | Open Door | Architectural Digest"

Rogen has entered into a lifetime deal to transfer full ownership of his personal autonomy to Netflix, Inc. \n\n‚ÄúI have known Seth for many years‚Äù said senior Netflix Development Executive Jareth Chumley. ‚ÄúAfter a wrap party in late 2017, Seth approached me and said something like ‚ÄòJesus Fucking Christ Jarbear, I would sell my soul for a fuckin enchilada right now.‚Äô And so basically that was how the idea was born. In the end we settled on a price a little higher than a standard Chili‚Äôs To-Go entree, but I‚Äôll be damned, not by that much.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs a general rule, I don‚Äôt really ‚Äòread‚Äô anything before I sign it,‚Äù replied Rogen when asked about the deal, spilling some beer on his own head as he does the finger-symbol equivalent of air quotes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Danny is for, he handles that for me, mostly,‚Äù gesturing toward an elderly man in a poncho sleeping on the couch behind him. ‚ÄúHey Danny!‚Äù he shouts, unable to wake his senior contract advisor. ‚ÄúI really hope he didn‚Äôt fuck this up. He‚Äôs the reason that Zach and Miri Make a Porno exists.‚Äù\n\nSeth Rogen‚Äôs Hilarity for Charity is the first project where Netflix was able to successfully extract comedy directly from the actor‚Äôs mind. It will stream April 6. While the remaining projects Rogen will be participating in have not yet been finalized, Netflix is considering a live-action Shrek remake, starring Rogen as both the titular character, as well as that character‚Äôs love interest Fiona. There will also be other tasks considered, including some off-camera roles such as ‚Äúexecutive foot massager‚Äù and ‚ÄúQuentin‚Äôs back waxer‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe world really is our oyster here,‚Äù said Netflix Chief Operations Officer Karen Shartwell. ‚ÄúThere really isn‚Äôt anything on earth that we can‚Äôt make him do.‚Äù\n\nWatch Hilarity For Charity on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80189646\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world‚Äôs leading Internet television network with over 117 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films.

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy.

Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.\n\nHelping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\n\nSuperstar: Brandon Victor Dixon - Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\nhttps://youtu.be/yleuZbY8rKk\n\nNBC on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc"

Facing environmental disasters and a plunging birthrate, Gilead is ruled by a twisted fundamentalism in its militarized ‚Äòreturn to traditional values'. As one of the few remaining fertile women, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is a Handmaid in the Commander‚Äôs household, one of the caste of women forced into sexual servitude as a last desperate attempt to repopulate the world. In this terrifying society, Offred must navigate between Commanders, their cruel Wives, domestic Marthas, and her fellow Handmaids ‚Äì where anyone could be a spy for Gilead ‚Äì all with one goal: to survive and find the daughter that was taken from her."

jZoHuMwZwTk,1899-1902 British Emergency Ration Field Service Oldest MRE Beef Eaten Survival Food Review Test,"Check out what British soldiers ate during The Second Boer Conflict of 1899-1902 when in a last ditch effort ! This is the second oldest thing I've ever eaten (Oldest was that Hardtack) and much unexpected considering this MRE's condition. It was pretty rough - and the smell when cooking the dried beef (Pretty much a pemmican) is nearly indescribable. It was quite the experience. And for old rations up next we will see the next generation in Emergency Rations - (1918). This is pioneering in food technology - the beef was still edible. It was a pulverized, slow cooked, dried, and compressed meat by-product bar. Way ahead of it's time - this was food tech that was adopted by the U.S. Quartermaster Corps of Sustenance and Natick Food Labs decades later.\n\nFor correspondence, or to send a Military Ration for review, my mailing information is: \nSteve1989\n3616 Harden Blvd\n#360\nLakeland, FL 33803 \n\nhttp://www.mremarketplace.com/\n\nhttp://www.mreinfo.com/\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=2821334&ty=h\n\nAnd thank you everyone for watching & subscribing - hope \nyou enjoyed this one, as I certainly did making it!\n-Steve\n** All Music By:  Steve1989 MREinfo **\n\n\nCheck out the other awesome YT reviewers:\n\n\nOldsmokey:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL1wSC0Ntw8KWgTM-TRHFOQ\n\nRC Gusto:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfBEYgWflPKsDI_i6AmD5sA\n\ngschultz9:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/gschultz9\n\nstickyfingaz745:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChEqR37txqYozXbbitVDd7A\n\n\ngundog4314:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7dAKknI_zWUNcz36T0Lp6w\n\nemmymadeinjapan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzqbfYjQmf9nLQPMxVgPhiA\n\nKiwi Dude:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIUTBxBxmMMY2bUJqYITJxw\n\n\nPaul Buikema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ51mn3lFHIyMYxX74ViCPg\n\nElandil:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCspVo4xdz9JPpPV6d6jp9wQ\n\nMrBrowningm1911\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVoA8_rDsAcMF2UkfCO4n4A\n\ndingo7055:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8dvHS5J4Kqn79p6ScmWqw\n\nSparrowMedicine:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8TnFxqRz-PTS-yowf6S5kw"

ZQ-YX-5bAs0,CRAZY RICH ASIANS - Official Trailer 1,"Every family has its crazy. Watch the new trailer for #CrazyRichAsians, only in theaters this August.\n‚Äî\nCRAZY RICH ASIANS follows native New Yorker Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) as she accompanies her longtime boyfriend, Nick Young (Henry Golding), to his best friend‚Äôs wedding in Singapore. Excited about visiting Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick‚Äôs family, Rachel is unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a few key details about his life. It turns out that he is not only the scion of one of the country‚Äôs wealthiest families but also one of its most sought-after bachelors. Being on Nick‚Äôs arm puts a target on Rachel‚Äôs back, with jealous socialites and, worse, Nick‚Äôs own disapproving mother (Michelle Yeoh) taking aim. And it soon becomes clear that while money can‚Äôt buy love, it can definitely complicate things.\n \nDirected by Jon M. Chu (‚ÄúNow You See Me 2‚Äù)  and based on the acclaimed worldwide bestseller by Kevin Kwan, the film features an international cast of stars, led by Constance Wu (‚ÄúFresh Off the Boat‚Äù); Henry Golding, making his feature film debut; Gemma Chan (‚ÄúHumans‚Äù); Lisa Lu (‚Äú2012‚Äù); and Awkwafina (upcoming ‚ÄúOcean‚Äôs 8,‚Äù ‚ÄúNeighbors 2‚Äù); with Ken Jeong (the ‚ÄúHangover‚Äù films‚Äù) and Michelle Yeoh (‚ÄúStar Trek: Discovery,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon‚Äù).  The large starring ensemble also includes Sonoya Mizuno (‚ÄúLa La Land‚Äù), Chris Pang (‚ÄúMarco Polo‚Äù), Jimmy O.

rRr1qiJRsXk,Sanju | Official Teaser | Ranbir Kapoor | Rajkumar Hirani,"Few lives in our times are as dramatic and enigmatic as the saga of Sanjay Dutt. Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of diehard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist.Sanju is in turns a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man‚Äôs battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking ‚Äúdid this really happen?‚Äù This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.Starring: Ranbir Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Vicky Kaushal, Jim Sarbh and Boman Irani.

ZQ-YX-5bAs0,CRAZY RICH ASIANS - Official Trailer 1,"Every family has its crazy. Watch the new trailer for #CrazyRichAsians, only in theaters this August.‚ÄîCRAZY RICH ASIANS follows native New Yorker Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) as she accompanies her longtime boyfriend, Nick Young (Henry Golding), to his best friend‚Äôs wedding in Singapore. Excited about visiting Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick‚Äôs family, Rachel is unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a few key details about his life. It turns out that he is not only the scion of one of the country‚Äôs wealthiest families but also one of its most sought-after bachelors. Being on Nick‚Äôs arm puts a target on Rachel‚Äôs back, with jealous socialites and, worse, Nick‚Äôs own disapproving mother (Michelle Yeoh) taking aim. And it soon becomes clear that while money can‚Äôt buy love, it can definitely complicate things. Directed by Jon M. Chu (‚ÄúNow You See Me 2‚Äù)  and based on the acclaimed worldwide bestseller by Kevin Kwan, the film features an international cast of stars, led by Constance Wu (‚ÄúFresh Off the Boat‚Äù); Henry Golding, making his feature film debut; Gemma Chan (‚ÄúHumans‚Äù); Lisa Lu (‚Äú2012‚Äù); and Awkwafina (upcoming ‚ÄúOcean‚Äôs 8,‚Äù ‚ÄúNeighbors 2‚Äù); with Ken Jeong (the ‚ÄúHangover‚Äù films‚Äù) and Michelle Yeoh (‚ÄúStar Trek: Discovery,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon‚Äù).  The large starring ensemble also includes Sonoya Mizuno (‚ÄúLa La Land‚Äù), Chris Pang (‚ÄúMarco Polo‚Äù), Jimmy O. Yang (‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù), comedian Ronny Chieng (‚ÄúThe Daily Show‚Äù), Remi Hii (‚ÄúMarco Polo‚Äù), Nico Santos (‚ÄúSuperstore‚Äù) and Jing Lusi (‚ÄúStan Lee‚Äôs Lucky Man‚Äù). Color Force‚Äôs Nina Jacobson (‚ÄúThe Hunger Games‚Äù films) and Brad Simpson (‚ÄúWorld War Z‚Äù), and Ivanhoe‚Äôs John Penotti (‚ÄúHell or High Water‚Äù) produced the film, with Tim Coddington, Robert Friedland, Sidney Kimmel and Kevin Kwan serving as executive producers.  The screenplay is by Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim, based on the novel by Kwan.‚ÄîFollow #CrazyRichAsians on social media:http://www.crazyrichasiansmovie.comhttp://facebook.com/crazyrichasiansmoviehttp://twitter.com/crazyrichmoviehttp://instagram.com/crazyrichasians"

jZoHuMwZwTk,1899-1902 British Emergency Ration Field Service Oldest MRE Beef Eaten Survival Food Review Test,"Check out what British soldiers ate during The Second Boer Conflict of 1899-1902 when in a last ditch effort ! This is the second oldest thing I've ever eaten (Oldest was that Hardtack) and much unexpected considering this MRE's condition. It was pretty rough - and the smell when cooking the dried beef (Pretty much a pemmican) is nearly indescribable. It was quite the experience. And for old rations up next we will see the next generation in Emergency Rations - (1918). This is pioneering in food technology - the beef was still edible. It was a pulverized, slow cooked, dried, and compressed meat by-product bar. Way ahead of it's time - this was food tech that was adopted by the U.S. Quartermaster Corps of Sustenance and Natick Food Labs decades later.For correspondence, or to send a Military Ration for review, my mailing information is: Steve19893616 Harden Blvd#360Lakeland, FL 33803 http://www.mremarketplace.com/http://www.mreinfo.com/https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2821334&ty=hAnd thank you everyone for watching & subscribing - hope you enjoyed this one, as I certainly did making it!-Steve** All Music By:  Steve1989 MREinfo **Check out the other awesome YT reviewers:Oldsmokey:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL1wSC0Ntw8KWgTM-TRHFOQRC Gusto:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfBEYgWflPKsDI_i6AmD5sAgschultz9:https://www.youtube.com/user/gschultz9stickyfingaz745:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChEqR37txqYozXbbitVDd7Agundog4314:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7dAKknI_zWUNcz36T0Lp6wemmymadeinjapan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzqbfYjQmf9nLQPMxVgPhiAKiwi Dude:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIUTBxBxmMMY2bUJqYITJxwPaul Buikema:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ51mn3lFHIyMYxX74ViCPgElandil:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCspVo4xdz9JPpPV6d6jp9wQMrBrowningm1911https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVoA8_rDsAcMF2UkfCO4n4Adingo7055:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8dvHS5J4Kqn79p6ScmWqwSparrowMedicine:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8TnFxqRz-PTS-yowf6S5kw"

1J76wN0TPI4,Sanju | Official Trailer | Ranbir Kapoor | Rajkumar Hirani | Releasing on 29th June,"Few lives in our times are as dramatic and enigmatic as the saga of Sanjay Dutt. Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of die-hard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist.Sanju is a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man‚Äôs battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking ‚Äúdid this really happen?‚Äù This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.Starring: Ranbir Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Vicky Kaushal, Jim Sarbh and Boman Irani.

JckuMy_aYso,"I FILLED MY SWIMMING POOL WITH 1,000 POOL FLOATIES!! üíßü¶Ñ","In todays ultimate video we took a break from box forts to try the FILLING MY SWIMMING POOL WITH 1,000 POOL FLOATIES CHALLENGE! This pool challenge was crazy as we filled my pool with 1,000 POOL floaties. We grabbed as many pool toys and pool floats as we could fin and dumped them in my pool. We played different pool games like floor is lava challenge and hide and seek in the pool. We even had the idea to maybe make a box fort or flute fort out of all these pool toys and try to survive in it for 24 hours just like in one of our 24 hour box fort challenges. Maybe in the next funny video we will take it a step farther and fill my pool with orbeez or water beads!   Giant balloon what happens if you orbeez into a balloon in a pool party? Say what comedy.
