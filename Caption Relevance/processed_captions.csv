abGCYPCk294,"Justice League Reactions, Should Disney Buy Netflix - The John Campea Show","On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Saturday, November 11th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nVIEWER TOPICS\n\nRob Sanders - Hi John. Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there‚Äôs nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar?

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it‚Äôs soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n ‚ÄúRampage‚Äù also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (‚ÄúMoonlight‚Äù), Malin Akerman (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúBillions‚Äù), Jake Lacy (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúGirls‚Äù), Joe Manganiello (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrue Blood‚Äù) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù); as well as P.J. Byrne (‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street‚Äù), Marley Shelton (‚ÄúSolace‚Äù), Breanne Hill (‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù), Jack Quaid (‚ÄúThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire‚Äù), and Matt Gerald (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúDaredevil‚Äù). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\n‚ÄúRampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit ‚ÄúSan Andreas.‚Äù  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, ‚ÄúStar Wars: The Last Jedi‚Äù), editor Jim May (‚ÄúGoosebumps‚Äù) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (‚ÄúDawn of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for ‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù and ‚ÄúJourney 2: The Mysterious Island.‚Äù\nThe ‚ÄúRampage‚Äù creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (‚ÄúSan Andreas,‚Äù ‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse‚Äù), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù Trilogy, ‚ÄúDawn of the Planet of the Apes‚Äù).\n\n‚ÄúRampage‚Äù opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, ‚ÄúRampage‚Äù will be distributed by Warner Bros.

Nz0qoOgyWSQ,"The Talk - Eve Reacts to Nicki Minaj's Racy Magazine Cover, 'I just don't think it's right'","Paper Magazine debuted a racy cover featuring Nicki Minaj. Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing.

oMupq6zB1Tc,Should Hillary Clinton Be Impeached?,"After public encouragement from Donald Trump, the Department of Justice is reportedly deciding whether or not to appoint a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton. Trump and his supporters are so very passionate about Hillary Clinton, it seems like maybe they forgot she lost. She is not the President but we went out on the street and asked people if Hillary Clinton should be impeached. She does not have a job but did that stop people from demanding she be removed from office?\n\nWORLD PREMIERE TRAILER ‚Äì Jimmy Kimmel‚Äôs The Terrific Ten https://youtu.be/t8Jq6NqCQ1o\n \nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest #KIMMEL: http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe\n \nWatch Mean Tweets: http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10\n \nConnect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online:\n \nVisit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite\nLike Jimmy Kimmel on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/KimmelFB\nLike Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook\nFollow @JimmyKimmel on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/KimmelTW\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter\nFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram\n \nAbout Jimmy Kimmel Live:\n \nJimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy-winning Jimmy Kimmel Live, ABC's late-night talk show.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live is well known for its huge viral video successes with 5.6 billion views on YouTube alone.\nSome of Kimmel's most popular comedy bits include - Mean Tweets, Lie Witness News, Jimmy's Twerk Fail Prank, Unnecessary Censorship, YouTube Challenge, The Baby Bachelor, Movie: The Movie, Handsome Men's Club, Jimmy Kimmel Lie Detective and music videos like I (Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum and a Blurred Lines parody with Robin Thicke, Pharrell, Jimmy and his security guard Guillermo.\nNow in its fifteenth season, Kimmel's guests have included: Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, Tom Cruise, Halle Berry, Harrison Ford, Jennifer Aniston, Will Ferrell, Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, George Clooney, Larry David, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Kobe Bryant, Steve Carell, Hugh Jackman, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Garner, Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, Amy Poehler, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, Oprah, and unfortunately Matt Damon.\n\nShould Hillary Clinton Be Impeached?\nhttps://youtu.be/oMupq6zB1Tc",hillary clinton impeached,public encouragement donald trump department justice reportedly deciding whether appoint special counsel investigate hillary clinton trump supporters passionate hillary clinton seems like maybe forgot lost president went street asked people hillary clinton impeached job stop people demanding removed officennworld premiere trailer jimmy kimmels terrific ten nsubscribe get latest kimmel nwatch mean tweets nconnect jimmy kimmel live onlinen nvisit jimmy kimmel live website jimmy kimmel facebook jimmy kimmel live facebook jimmykimmel twitter jimmy kimmel live twitter jimmy kimmel live instagram nabout jimmy kimmel liven njimmy kimmel serves host executive producer emmywinning jimmy kimmel live abcs latenight talk shownnjimmy kimmel live well known huge viral video successes 56 billion views youtube alonensome kimmels popular comedy bits include mean tweets lie witness news jimmys twerk fail prank unnecessary censorship youtube challenge baby bachelor movie movie handsome mens club jimmy kimmel lie detective music videos like wanna channing tatum blurred lines parody robin thicke pharrell jimmy security guard guillermonnow fifteenth season kimmels guests included johnny depp meryl streep tom cruise halle berry harrison ford jennifer aniston ferrell katy perry tom hanks scarlett johansson channing tatum george clooney larry david charlize theron mark wahlberg kobe bryant steve carell hugh jackman kristen wiig jeff bridges jennifer garner ryan gosling bryan cranston jamie foxx amy poehler ben affleck robert downey jr jake gyllenhaal oprah unfortunately matt damonnnshould hillary clinton impeachedn
Y2-JjnW3w2g,"Who Matt Reeves Wants As Batman, Is Basmati Blues Culturally Insensitive? The John Campe Show","On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Thursday, November 16th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nShahrukh Ali - My question is how can the studios release films that have seemingly incomplete or poor CGI ? Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\n\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\n\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\n\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as it‚Äôs always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\n\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point. Is Matt Reeves is still working on a stand alone Batman film or would that be cancelled if Affleck walks?",matt reeves wants batman basmati blues culturally insensitive john campe show,episode john campea show recorded thursday november 16th 2017 john discusses following topicsnnsupport john patreon ali question studios release films seemingly incomplete poor cgi deadline keep ran budget simply havent noticed people like see poor cgi work come experts studios comfortable releasing films itnnpatreon supporter anurag p big fan since amc days dont know seen recent trailer new brie larson movie basmati blues trailer whole really gave impression another white person trying come india save playing common indian stereotypes indian increasingly frustrating seeming many indian actors typecast indian culture used fashionnnalejandro alonzo hey john case lot marvel movies bad villains great heroe development critics usually like movies enough give fresh review rt weve hearing similar comments jl turns movie gets rotten case made negative bias around wb positive one around marvelnnpatreon supporter alan dale hi john talk time highest box office grossing movies isnt adjusted inflation taken account surely box office based number actual tickets sold per film im sure time top 10 list films would look different please explain always puzzled thanks keep great worknnfrancisca ramirez ben done batman seems like foregone conclusion point matt reeves still working stand alone batman film would cancelled affleck walks
PGWBA_OzCE4,Deadpool 2 Teaser Released - Movie Talk,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday November 15th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Kristian Harloff, Jon Schnepp, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \n\n-First teaser released for Daedpool 2\n\n-Rotten Tomatoes Will Delay the Reveal of ‚ÄòJustice League‚Äôs Tomatometer Score\n\n-Tarantino‚Äôs next movie down to 3 studio front-runners Sony, Paramount and WB; Tom Cruise eyed for lead role\n\n-Animated Super Mario Bros. movie in development at Illumination and Universal\n\n-‚ÄòHalloween‚Äô Reboot Timeline Confirmed by Danny McBride\n\n-What Women Want remake ‚ÄòWhat Men Want‚Äô in the works at Paramount; Empire‚Äôs Taraji P. Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won‚Äôt be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET‚Äînearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there‚Äôs a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it‚Äôs likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination‚Äôs Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse‚Äôs new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we‚Äôll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‚Äòs Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues. When she gains the power to hear men‚Äôs thoughts, she is able to take advantage of the gift and races to sign the NBA‚Äôs next superstar. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",deadpool 2 teaser released movie talk,episode collider movie talk wednesday november 15th 2017 mark ellis kristian harloff jon schnepp ashley mova discuss following nnfirst teaser released daedpool 2nnrotten tomatoes delay reveal justice leagues tomatometer scorenntarantinos next movie 3 studio frontrunners sony paramount wb tom cruise eyed lead rolennanimated super mario bros movie development illumination universalnnhalloween reboot timeline confirmed danny mcbridennwhat women want remake men want works paramount empires taraji p henson starnnmail bagnnlive twitter questionsnnthanks report playlist looks though rotten tomatoes wont unveiling score justice league thursday 1201am etnearly full day reviews go online reason actually comes part promotion new see itskip show facebook rotten tomatoes officially unveil score new releases though many taken online say theres massive conspiracy afoot wb trying delay score movie drops thursday night showings likely simply promotion rotten tomatoes original seriesnnin new report variety three studios emerged frontrunners distribute quentin tarantinos next movie top three include warner bros sony paramount warners actually transforming lot match time period using warner bros logo 1969 marquee outside studio sony also reportedly created big pitch focused marketing domestic previously reported tarantino eying margot robbie role sharon tate said also written roles brad pitt leonardo dicaprio tom cruisennbuy sellnnin report wall street journal illumination entertainment nearing agreement nintendo make animated super mario bros movie based iconic video game illumination owned chris meledandri universal studios produced despicable secret life pets franchises illuminations mac guff studio paris currently early stages development release date yet determined nnin recent appearance cbs sunday morning original halloween creator john carpenter revealed blumhouses new halloween movie would ignore sequels declined reveal much else bit clarity courtesy cowriter danny mcbride interview yahoo mcbride definitively revealed time frame well see upcoming horror redonndeadline reports paramount players signed empires taraji p henson star men want comedy remake inspired 2000 nancy meyers hit romantic comedy women want new version follows female sports agent constantly boxed male colleagues gains power hear mens thoughts able take advantage gift races sign nbas next superstar nnmail bagnnlive twitter questionsnncheck youtube playlist awesometacular us twitter us instagram us facebook mark kristian schnepp ashley online source movies television breaking news incisive content imminent trends collider videos essential destinationnnvisit collider twitter schmoes youtube channel show schedulennmonday tv talk nntuesday heroes schmoedown nnwednesday nightmares nnthursday jedi council nnfriday schmoedown nnsaturday mailbag nnbehind scenesbloopers mailbag talk every week day

when she called me on those nights\nI would always regret what would happen in those fights\nFrom feeling so alive to almost nothing that‚Äôs no life\nBut that‚Äôs your life and what you‚Äôve come to expect\nRelationships are damaged so you try to protect\nEmotions that you manage they are starting to wreck\nAnd the ones you hold so close man you can barely connect\nBut we are on a quest for something greater then we know\nIt‚Äôs often a battle of man vs the fear of the unknown\nWhen the concept of home, is a construct that‚Äôs grown\nFrom meaning where you live to sometimes life alone\nAnd for me that line is blurring like each day \nFighting even harder now to hold on to my faith\nBarely recognizing when I‚Äôm looking at my face\nBut that‚Äôs the life I‚Äôve chosen as I‚Äôm searching for my place, and at my pace\n\nCHORUS:\nThey say that we‚Äôre runners\nBut I can‚Äôt seem to disagree\nGonna lose my way, gotta make mistakes\nFind out who I‚Äôm meant to be \n\nVERSE 2\nThis scarcity of time of we play into it so much \nIt‚Äôs scary, for most of us it‚Äôs often a soul crush \nBut varies, and is extreme but follow me closely \nCuz this privledge evokes freedom that most of us don‚Äôt see\nIt makes us run off so fast without a clear direction or purpose \nNervous Imperfections they soon start to surface\nIs it all worth it, with every choice we‚Äôre unearthing  \nOften leaves us with feelings of unknowns and burdens\nAnd I‚Äôve heard it in the voices of most peers around me \nand they speak resounding voices echoing and pounding \nthe same message that‚Äôs been hounding me every day\nThat this safety that we seek is what we have to blame\nAll I ever wanted was everything every moment at once\nI wanted everything, and having it wasn‚Äôt ever ever enough \nI wanted everything, but at each moment evolved  \nSo instead of having anything, I just ran away from it all, its so easy\nVERSE 3\nSo when I finally come back, I wanna do it right\nBut how long that takes and how much I sleep at night\nIs way too beyond me, because I will end up wandering\nAnd the fact I may not find what I‚Äôm looking for is daunting\nIt is haunting, but has me wanting it even more\nAnd most nights I don‚Äôt even know why or who I do it for,\nBut some nights it‚Äôs aces strange sounds and faces\nTowns that escape me in the most far off of places\nAnd I love it, it‚Äôs this reason why I‚Äôm even writing of it\nWith every lesson that I‚Äôm taught I would be nothing\nThese great minds have inspired and made me, I was tired of it lately\nBut Thankfully what I admired is blatantly \nMaking me accept, there‚Äôs not a thing as coming back\nCuz with each path I take a new one attracts \nAnd as lost as I am to you, I owe it to this pursuit\nOf truth that once grew from a seed I once knew when I was young",runners danakadan official music video wong fu presents,check support amazing artistsnstream scenes album written danakadan travis atreo tyler carrollnperformed

when she called me on those nights\nI would always regret what would happen in those fights\nFrom feeling so alive to almost nothing that‚Äôs no life\nBut that‚Äôs your life and what you‚Äôve come to expect\nRelationships are damaged so you try to protect\nEmotions that you manage they are starting to wreck\nAnd the ones you hold so close man you can barely connect\nBut we are on a quest for something greater then we know\nIt‚Äôs often a battle of man vs the fear of the unknown\nWhen the concept of home, is a construct that‚Äôs grown\nFrom meaning where you live to sometimes life alone\nAnd for me that line is blurring like each day \nFighting even harder now to hold on to my faith\nBarely recognizing when I‚Äôm looking at my face\nBut that‚Äôs the life I‚Äôve chosen as I‚Äôm searching for my place, and at my pace\n\nCHORUS:\nThey say that we‚Äôre runners\nBut I can‚Äôt seem to disagree\nGonna lose my way, gotta make mistakes\nFind out who I‚Äôm meant to be \n\nVERSE 2\nThis scarcity of time of we play into it so much \nIt‚Äôs scary, for most of us it‚Äôs often a soul crush \nBut varies, and is extreme but follow me closely \nCuz this privledge evokes freedom that most of us don‚Äôt see\nIt makes us run off so fast without a clear direction or purpose \nNervous Imperfections they soon start to surface\nIs it all worth it, with every choice we‚Äôre unearthing  \nOften leaves us with feelings of unknowns and burdens\nAnd I‚Äôve heard it in the voices of most peers around me \nand they speak resounding voices echoing and pounding \nthe same message that‚Äôs been hounding me every day\nThat this safety that we seek is what we have to blame\nAll I ever wanted was everything every moment at once\nI wanted everything, and having it wasn‚Äôt ever ever enough \nI wanted everything, but at each moment evolved  \nSo instead of having anything, I just ran away from it all, its so easy\nVERSE 3\nSo when I finally come back, I wanna do it right\nBut how long that takes and how much I sleep at night\nIs way too beyond me, because I will end up wandering\nAnd the fact I may not find what I‚Äôm looking for is daunting\nIt is haunting, but has me wanting it even more\nAnd most nights I don‚Äôt even know why or who I do it for,\nBut some nights it‚Äôs aces strange sounds and faces\nTowns that escape me in the most far off of places\nAnd I love it, it‚Äôs this reason why I‚Äôm even writing of it\nWith every lesson that I‚Äôm taught I would be nothing\nThese great minds have inspired and made me, I was tired of it lately\nBut Thankfully what I admired is blatantly \nMaking me accept, there‚Äôs not a thing as coming back\nCuz with each path I take a new one attracts \nAnd as lost as I am to you, I owe it to this pursuit\nOf truth that once grew from a seed I once knew when I was young",runners music video wong fu presents,check support amazing artistsnstream scenes album written danakadan travis atreo tyler carrollnperformed danakadan dia

But despite their uneasy bond, the new allies face overwhelming odds: outnumbered and outgunned by a ruthless enemy that does not take prisoners.\n\nDirected by Nicolai Fuglsig and based on the acclaimed ‚ÄúHorse Soldiers‚Äù book by best-selling author Doug Stanton, 12 STRONG also stars Michael Pe√±a, Navid Negahban, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, Austin Stowell, Ben O‚ÄôToole, Austin Hebert, Kenneth Miller, Kenny Sheard, Jack Kesy, Laith Nakli, Fahim Fazli, Yousuf Azami, Said Taghmaoui, Elsa Pataky, William Fichtner, and Rob Riggle.\n‚Äî\nFollow #12StrongMovie on social media:\nhttp://12strongmovie.com \nhttp://facebook.com/12StrongMovie \nhttp://twitter.com/12StrongMovie \nhttp://instagram.com/12StrongMovie",12 strong official trailer 2,darkest day greatest hope watch new trailer 12strongmoviennchris hemsworth oscar nominee michael shannon star 12 strong powerful new war drama alcon entertainment black label media jerry bruckheimer films nnset harrowing days following 911 us special forces team led new captain mitch nelson chris hemsworth chosen first us troops sent afghanistan extremely dangerous mission rugged mountains must convince northern alliance general dostum navid negahban join forces fight common adversary taliban al qaeda allies addition overcoming mutual distrust vast cultural divide americansaccustomed stateoftheart warfaremust adopt rudimentary tactics afghani horse soldiers despite uneasy bond new allies face overwhelming odds outnumbered outgunned ruthless enemy take prisonersnndirected nicolai fuglsig based acclaimed horse soldiers book bestselling author doug stanton 12 strong also stars michael pe√±a navid negahban trevante rhodes geoff stults thad luckinbill austin stowell ben otoole austin hebert kenneth miller kenny sheard jack kesy laith nakli fahim fazli yousuf azami said taghmaoui elsa pataky william fichtner rob rigglennfollow 12strongmovie social median n n n

7cTi6PHUqMw,Are Critics What Killed Justice League? Sony Pay Too Much For Tarantino? - The John Campea Show,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Tuesday, November 21st 2017) John talks about the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nMeghan Dunn - I really liked Murder on the Orient Express and I just heard that Fox is setting up a sequel with Death on the Nile. Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JL‚Äôs poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about. Do you have any thoughts on their marketing of this movie so far?",critics killed justice league sony pay much tarantino john campea show,episode john campea show recorded tuesday november 21st 2017 john talks following topicsnnsupport john patreon dunn really liked murder orient express heard fox setting sequel death nile know kenneth branagh coming backnncameron often see people talk marvel dc universal conjuring comes cinematic universes come one talks legendarys monsterverse seem well critically financially plus theres four confirmed movies godzilla 2014 kong skull island godzilla king monsters godzilla vs kong two coming soonnnsean burtt everyone buzzing new tarantino movie get idea interesting exciting reports 93 million budget one pay attention hateful eight made money would sony pay money history doesnt really justify itnnkyle recently former colleagues suggested jls poor performance due solely response critics find ridiculous critics much effect opening weekend numbers suicide squad open bigger critics targeted trying protect consumernnmarcus mann hey john love show watching since collider days said several movies come miss marketed like jl murder orient express saw trailer ready player one weekend idea thoughts marketing movie far

EP5ExDvQ3p4,Avengers 4: Who Will Die? - Movie Talk,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday November 28th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Perri Nemiroff, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \n\n1) Kevin Feige teases ‚Äòfinale‚Äô of MCU with Avengers 4\n\n2) James Cameron Says if ‚ÄòAvatar‚Äô 2 & 3 Flop There Won‚Äôt Be ‚ÄòAvatar‚Äô 4 & 5\n\n3) Opening This Week ‚Äì The Disaster Artist\n\n4) Russell Crowe Teases Potential Movement on a ‚ÄòMaster and Commander‚Äô Sequel\n\n5) ‚ÄòLady Bird‚Äô Becomes the Best-Reviewed Movie of All-Time on Rotten Tomatoes\n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nIn a sprawling profile in Vanity Fair about the 10-year anniversary of Marvel Studios, the magazine revealed that after the conclusion of Avengers 4, ‚Äúat least some of the original characters who sit at the center of the billion-dollar Avengers team will be hanging up their capes and shields.‚Äù Head honcho Kevin Feige also teased what‚Äôs to come after Avengers 4, saying they have about 20 completely different Marvel movies in development, with Avengers 4 acting as the ‚ÄúFinale‚Äù to the MCU as we know it. \n\nWhile production has already begun on James Cameron‚Äôs Avatar 2 and Avatar 3, the director recently revealed to Vanity Fair that if parts 2 and 3 don‚Äôt do well at the box office, then Fox will not move forward on parts 4 and 5. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nIn 2003, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World earned 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Peter Weird, and scored two wins for Best Cinematography and Sound Editing. But against a budget of $150 million, the film only made $212 million at the box office, making its sequel prospects unlikely. Now, 15 years later, Russell Crowe has taken to his Twitter account saying a Master and Commander sequel may actually be happening. \n\nWhile it‚Äôs very hard to score a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, it‚Äôs not impossible. In the history of the aggregator site, only one movie has scored a perfect 100 and that was Toy Story 2, with 163 reviews certified fresh. But now, we have a new champion and it comes in the form of Greta Gerwig‚Äôs Lady Bird. The film now has 164 reviews, all of them ‚ÄúFresh‚Äù, giving the film a 100% Fresh rating, as well as crowning it the best reviewed movie of all time. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Perri: https://twitter.com/PNemiroff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",avengers 4 die movie talk,episode collider movie talk tuesday november 28th 2017 mark ellis jon schnepp perri nemiroff ashley mova discuss following nn1 kevin feige teases finale mcu avengers 4nn2 james cameron says avatar 2 3 flop wont avatar 4 5nn3 opening week disaster artistnn4 russell crowe teases potential movement master commander sequelnn5 lady bird becomes bestreviewed movie alltime rotten tomatoesnn6 mail bagnn7 live twitter questionsnnin sprawling profile vanity fair 10year anniversary marvel studios magazine revealed conclusion avengers 4 least original characters sit center billiondollar avengers team hanging capes shields head honcho kevin feige also teased whats come avengers 4 saying 20 completely different marvel movies development avengers 4 acting finale mcu know nnwhile production already begun james camerons avatar 2 avatar 3 director recently revealed vanity fair parts 2 3 dont well box office fox move forward parts 4 5 nnopening weeknnin 2003 master commander far side world earned 10 oscar nominations including best picture best director peter weird scored two wins best cinematography sound editing budget 150 million film made 212 million box office making sequel prospects unlikely 15 years later russell crowe taken twitter account saying master commander sequel may actually happening nnwhile hard score perfect 100 rotten tomatoes impossible history aggregator site one movie scored perfect 100 toy story 2 163 reviews certified fresh new champion comes form greta gerwigs lady bird film 164 reviews fresh giving film 100 fresh rating well crowning best reviewed movie time nnmail bagnnlive twitter questionsnncheck youtube playlist awesometacular us twitter us instagram us facebook mark perri schnepp ashley online source movies television breaking news incisive content imminent trends collider videos essential destinationnnvisit collider twitter schmoes youtube channel show schedulennmonday tv talk nntuesday heroes schmoedown nnwednesday nightmares nnthursday jedi council nnfriday schmoedown nnsaturday mailbag nnbehind scenesbloopers mailbag talk every week day

6d6SmcYcP_U,Twitter Is FURIOUS VS Fashion Show Aired Model's Runway Fall UNEDITED,"Thank you to Xfinity Mobile for sponsoring this episode. Learn more about Xfinity Mobile ‚Äì a new kind of network that combines America‚Äôs largest most reliable 4G LTE with the most WiFi hotspots. http://bit.ly/XFINITY_MOBILE\n\nMore Celebrity News ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nWelp, turns out CBS decided not to edit out model Ming Xi (SHEE)‚Äôs fall during last night‚Äôs airing of the Victoria Secret fashion show. This episode of Newsfeed is brought to you by Xfinity Mobile. It‚Äôs a new kind of network.\n\nSooo that‚Äôs embarrassing‚Ä¶\n\nRumor was that CBS would probably edit out Ming‚Äôs fall on the catwalk at last week‚Äôs pre-taped Victoria Secret fashion show‚Ä¶After all, CBS has taken out other awkward flubs at the show in the past, like last year when Ariana Grande got smacked in the face with angel wings. But that was not the case with this tumble.\nYa know why they didn‚Äôt cut this out? Because it was TV gold and great publicity. I mean, we‚Äôre talking about it right now and so are most media outlets. To amp up the drama further, they sliced in backstage audio from the producers. Check this out‚Ä¶\n\nIt‚Äôs truly like a car crash. I don‚Äôt want to look, but I have to. My friend and editor at Cosmopolitan, Alex Rees, shares my sentiments, tweeting‚Ä¶‚Äùomg and she's crying (tbh its a bit f-ed up to air this part imho but then i recorded the footage to share on twitter so i dont really have a point i guess).‚Äù\nIt got even sadder when they show Ming in tears after exiting the runway.\n\nFans have been vocal about their feelings about the final edit of the show on twitter. \n\nOne viewer tweeted, ‚ÄúPretty uncool of Victoria's Secret to not only show Ming Xi fall, but then also show her crying backstage.‚Äù\nAnother viewer was annoyed that they didn‚Äôt use footage from the dress rehearsal instead writing, ‚ÄúThe vsfs is filmed twice. I‚Äôm disgusted that they showed Ming Xi fall, like honestly? Why did they do her like that? They embarrassed her in front of millions of people. I‚Äôm so disappointed in Victoria Secret right now.‚Äù\n\nUgh, poor, Ming. And if you thought it couldn‚Äôt be more embarrassing‚Ä¶the fall happened in front of a hometown crowd in Shanghai. The model wrote this in an Instagram caption following the incident last week. \n\n‚ÄúIt was no doubt one of the hardest moments I have ever had to go through in my career, especially since the show was taking place in my hometown, in front of my mother's and my people's eyes. However, the support I received from everyone yesterday was incredible and I am truly grateful to everyone who was there for me.‚Äù\n\nI know they‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúangels, but am I horrible for saying I appreciated this humanizing moment.

MQSRmx9zS64,Top 10 Strangest Things That Happen To Your Body In Space,"Space is the final frontier. Being in zero gravity for extended periods of time does some wacky things to the human body. Unless aliens show up and teach us how to deal with these unique challenges, it‚Äôs up to scientists to discover ways for the human body to cope.\nSubscribe for more! ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/BeAmazedSubscribe ‚óÑ\nStay updated ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/BeAmazedFacebook https://twitter.com/BeAmazedVideos https://instagram.com/BeAmazedVideos ‚óÑ \nFor copyright queries or general inquiries please get in touch: beamazedvideos@gmail.com\nCredit: https://pastebin.com/zqUjCLhq\n\nBe Amazed at these Top 10 Things That Happen To Your Body In Space! Muscle Atrophy - Gravity, of course, is what allows you to walk around on the earth with your feet on the ground. In space, your main mode of transportation is floating instead.  Space Eurphoria - The mind is the most important part of the body, so how is it affected by living up in space? Many astronauts have reported that their time in space was a seriously enlightening and perspective changing time of their life. Space Radiation - Luckily for us down here on earth, our atmosphere protects us from cosmic radiation. However, Astronauts outside this atmosphere - out in space - do not have this luxurious blanket, and so they're exposed to ten times more radiation than they would be if they were on earth. Vision problems - If you spend too much time in space, the backs of your eyeballs will flatten just a tiny little bit. This is as bad as it sounds, and it causes your vision to blur. \n\nA Strange Smell - One question that isn‚Äôt really explored in many science fiction books or films is what exactly does space smell like? Wouldn‚Äôt it just smell like whatever earth smells like? Space Adaption Syndrome - If you go too long without earths‚Äô gravity holding down your body, you could end up with ‚Äúspace sickness‚Äù, formally known as space adaption syndrome. Confinement Craziness - If you have a family, a roommate, or have even simply interacted with another human being, you should know that if you put a bunch of people in a confined area for an extended period of time, problems are bound to arise. Your immune system gets worse - Space also takes a toll on your immune system, which you need to protect your body against diseases more than ever in space. You‚Äôll lose bone mass - Here on earth, you maintain your bones thanks to the natural power of gravity and mechanical loading. Osteoblasts, which are cells that regulate the bone matrix, and osteoclasts, which absorb one matrix, continually remodel your bone mass. Your heart weakens - The heart, perhaps the most important muscle you have, is also affected by a lack of gravity. The very size and shape of the human heart is changed by a trip to space.",top 10 strangest things happen body space,space final frontier zero gravity extended periods time wacky things human body unless aliens show teach us deal unique challenges scientists discover ways human body copensubscribe nstay updated nfor copyright queries general inquiries please get touch beamazedvideosgmailcomncredit amazed top 10 things happen body space muscle atrophy gravity course allows walk around earth feet ground space main mode transportation floating instead space eurphoria mind important part body affected living space many astronauts reported time space seriously enlightening perspective changing time life space radiation luckily us earth atmosphere protects us cosmic radiation however astronauts outside atmosphere space luxurious blanket theyre exposed ten times radiation would earth vision problems spend much time space backs eyeballs flatten tiny little bit bad sounds causes vision blur nna strange smell one question isnt really explored many science fiction books films exactly space smell like wouldnt smell like whatever earth smells like space adaption syndrome go long without earths gravity holding body could end space sickness formally known space adaption syndrome confinement craziness family roommate even simply interacted another human know put bunch people confined area extended period time problems bound arise immune system gets worse space also takes toll immune system need protect body diseases ever space youll lose bone mass earth maintain bones thanks natural power gravity mechanical loading osteoblasts cells regulate bone matrix osteoclasts absorb one matrix continually remodel bone mass heart weakens heart perhaps important muscle also affected lack gravity size shape human heart changed trip space

I am fan  from Czech Republic. I grew up watching 90¬¥s X-Men cartoon and i loved it. I like X-Men movies but i was really disappointed in the portrayal of my favourite character, Gambit. I was looking forward for his solo movie. But I don't hear any news anymore. It¬¥s that movie still happening or not?\n\nJessica Kang - I wanted to know your thoughts on the upcoming Lucille Ball biopic.  As a HUGE Lucille Ball fan, it amazes me that they haven‚Äôt done a proper biopic on her yet.  She had such a fascinating life and I would love to see the backstage drama told without any sugarcoat.  Love your insight and your logic and of course, keep bringing on the filthy!\n\nTaylor Pechter - I've watched the Inifinty War trailer a few times. I enjoyed it, but one thing gave me pause. At the end of the trailer, you have The Avengers running at another army of faceless, canon-fodder monsters. Do you think this is the climax? I hope not because this has been a trope ever since the first Avengers and is kind of becoming tiresome. What do you think? \n\nAlijah Brown - Hey John deadpool 2 will definitely be a smash hit next year or at least that's what I assume. How do you think the film will hold up against a super blockbuster like Infinity war. 2018 is certainly packed with comic book movies. A lot of competition. Your thoughts?\n\nRoger Daultry - There are reports that Bryan Singer has gone awol several times during the shooting of the Queen Biopic and Fox has just halted production because of Singer‚Äôs ‚Äúunexpected unavailability‚Äù. His publicist put out a statement that it‚Äôs because of a family health matter. My question is: Do you believe him or is there a deeper problem happening here?

I think that you have history and a past with someone and love, and just because it doesn't work out the first time, the second time, as long as there's not too much damage done, then, it can always work out again.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

t9JlSrTH9r0,Quentin Tarantino Developing New Star Trek Movie - Movie Talk,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday December 5th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, John Rocha, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) Bryan Singer fired from Bohemian Rhapsody\n\n2) Rian Johnson Talks New ‚ÄòStar Wars‚Äô Trilogy Plans and If He‚Äôll Direct All Three Films\n\n3) Opening This Week \n\n4) Zachary Levi Says Shazam Could Surprise Like Guardians of the Galaxy\n\n5) James Franco Set to Direct & Star in Shel Silverstein Biopic ‚ÄòA Boy Named Shel‚Äô\n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nJust as news broke that Fox had halted production on the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, THR is now reporting that director Bryan Singer has been fired from the production. The trade details a long list of reasons that include clashes between him and his Freddie Mercury actor Rami Malek, absences from the set that would force cinematographer Thomas Newton Sigel to step in and direct; and actor Tom Hollander, who plays Queen manager Jim Beach, is said to have briefly quit the film because of the director‚Äôs behavior, but was persuaded to return. \n\nWith Star Wars The Last Jedi ready to debut in theatres next Friday, director Rian Johnson is now making the press rounds on the promotional tour. Not surprising, The Last Jedi talk soon turned to his new trilogy of films separate from the Saga, which is said to be a whole new story with characters we‚Äôve yet to meet. Collider‚Äôs own Steve Weintraub spoke to Johnson about the new trilogy and asked if he‚Äôd like to direct all three movies.\n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nSpeaking at the recent Heroes & Villains convention in San Jose, CA - Shazam himself, Zachary Levi, talked a bit about the upcoming adaptation, revealing that he thinks the movie could surprise audiences in the same way Marvel‚Äôs Guardians of the Galaxy did.\n\nIn a report from Deadline, James Franco is in talks to direct and star in a film about children‚Äôs book author Shel Silverstein. Writers Chris Shafer and Paul Vicknair will pen the adaptation based on Lisa Rogak‚Äôs book ‚ÄúA Boy Named Shel.‚Äù Silverstein, a poet, singer, songwriter, and screenwriter, has seen his work translated into more than 30 languages, selling over 20 million copies in total. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Rocha: https://twitter.com/TheRochaSays\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",quentin tarantino developing new star trek movie movie talk,episode collider movie talk tuesday december 5th 2017 mark ellis jon schnepp john rocha ashley mova discuss following nn1 bryan singer fired bohemian rhapsodynn2 rian johnson talks new star wars trilogy plans hell direct three filmsnn3 opening week nn4 zachary levi says shazam could surprise like guardians galaxynn5 james franco set direct star shel silverstein biopic boy named shelnn6 mail bagnn7 live twitter questionsnnjust news broke fox halted production queen biopic bohemian rhapsody thr reporting director bryan singer fired production trade details long list reasons include clashes freddie mercury actor rami malek absences set would force cinematographer thomas newton sigel step direct actor tom hollander plays queen manager jim beach said briefly quit film directors behavior persuaded return nnwith star wars last jedi ready debut theatres next friday director rian johnson making press rounds promotional tour surprising last jedi talk soon turned new trilogy films separate saga said whole new story characters weve yet meet colliders steve weintraub spoke johnson new trilogy asked hed like direct three moviesnnopening weeknnspeaking recent heroes villains convention san jose ca shazam zachary levi talked bit upcoming adaptation revealing thinks movie could surprise audiences way marvels guardians galaxy didnnin report deadline james franco talks direct star film childrens book author shel silverstein writers chris shafer paul vicknair pen adaptation based lisa rogaks book boy named shel silverstein poet singer songwriter screenwriter seen work translated 30 languages selling 20 million copies total nnmail bagnnlive twitter questionsnncheck youtube playlist awesometacular us twitter us instagram us facebook mark rocha schnepp ashley online source movies television breaking news incisive content imminent trends collider videos essential destinationnnvisit collider twitter schmoes youtube channel show schedulennmonday tv talk nntuesday heroes schmoedown nnwednesday nightmares nnthursday jedi council nnfriday schmoedown nnsaturday mailbag nnbehind scenesbloopers mailbag talk every week day

xkYpO9ATUT0,Riverdale | Mad World | The CW,"Riverdale is new Wednesdays at 8/7c only on The CW, and available next day on The CW App: http://go.cwtv.com/genRVRyt\n \nSUBSCRIBE: http://go.cwtv.com/YTSubscribe\n \nAbout RIVERDALE:\nAs a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom ‚Äî and nothing feels the same. Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer‚Äôs events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale‚Äôs young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It‚Äôs all weighing heavily on Archie‚Äôs mind ‚Äî as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she‚Äôs not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty‚Äôs nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (M√§dchen Amick), aren‚Äôt the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there‚Äôs an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn‚Äôt want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there‚Äôs Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale‚Äôs Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, RIVERDALE is from Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúGlee‚Äù), Greg Berlanti (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù), Sarah Schechter (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù) and Jon Goldwater (Archie Comics).\n\nConnect with RIVERDALE Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE : http://cwtv.com/shows/riverdale\nLike RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/CWRiverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CW_Riverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thecwriverdale/\n\nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow, Dynasty, Valor, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Black Lightning, and Life Sentence.\n\nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nRiverdale | Mad World | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision",riverdale mad world cw,riverdale new wednesdays 87c cw available next day cw app nsubscribe nabout riverdalenas new school year begins town riverdale reeling recent tragic death high school golden boy jason blossom nothing feels archie andrews kj apa still allamerican teen summers events made realize wants pursue career music follow dads footsteps despite sudden end forbidden relationship riverdales young music teacher ms grundy sarah habel archie one mentor certainly singer josie mccoy ashleigh murray focused band soontobeworldfamous pussycats weighing heavily archies mind fractured friendship budding writer fellow classmate jughead jones cole sprouse nnmeanwhile girlnextdoor betty cooper lili reinhart anxious see crush archie away summer shes quite ready reveal true feelings bettys nerves hardly soothed overbearing mother alice m√§dchen amick arent thing holding back new student veronica lodge camila mendes arrives town new york mother hermione marisol nichols theres undeniable spark veronica archie even though veronica doesnt want risk new friendship betty making play archie theres cheryl blossom madelaine petsch riverdales queen bee happy stir trouble amongst archie betty veronica cheryl keeping secrets exactly hiding mysterious death twin brother jason riverdale may look like quiet sleepy town dangers shadows nbased characters archie comics riverdale warner bros television cbs television studios association berlanti productions executive producers roberto aguirresacasa supergirl glee greg berlanti arrow flash supergirl dcs legends tomorrow sarah schechter arrow flash supergirl dcs legends tomorrow jon goldwater archie comicsnnconnect riverdale onlinenlearn riverdale riverdale facebook riverdale twitter riverdale instagram cwnofficial youtube channel cw television network featuring hit series riverdale well flash arrow supergirl dcs legends tomorrow dynasty valor supernatural jane virgin crazy exgirlfriend originals 100 izombie black lightning life sentencennconnect cw onlinenvisit cw website cw facebook cw twitter nfollow cw instagram cw tumblr cw google cw pinterest nriverdale mad world cwn

JP5BL-lCoQI,Why Avengers Infinity War Will Succeed Where Justice League Failed - The John Campea Show,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Tuesday, December 5th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nJerry Montgomery - I was one of the people who got frustrated at the Frozen short that played before Coco. Loved Coco, and the short wasn‚Äôt bad, but at north of 20 minutes long it just made for a lot longer evening for the kids than I was banking on. Did Disney actually hear the complaints and pull it from the screenings?\n\nHussain Shah - Hi John, congrats on 100,000 subs just waiting for the other 900,000 to find your fantastic channel. I'm wondering your thoughts on Netflix's Oscar chances? Do you feel they'll have a chance or do the academy just have a prejudice against online streaming?

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.

8H0alk0e0tg,Could Kevin Feige Save DC? Does Alita Battle Angel Look Great Or Terrible? The John Campea Show,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Saturday, December 9th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nPATREON Supporter Jacob Bullard - Do you think Tarantino's association, regardless of the film's quality, will hamper the next Trek film's financial success? Django (Tarantino‚Äôs record) made $425mil. I fear many people, especially families, will avoid it because of assumptions drawn from Tarantino's past films. Even the general audience knows his movies are more extreme than average R-rated films. \n\nMathew Garet - Kind of a random question, do you find it as odd as I do that, JA Bayona isn't the one announcing trailers on social media, but it was actually Colin Trevorrow? Appreciate everything you do John! \n\nSamuel Polay - I just watched the trailer for Alita battle angel and my reaction can be summed in one word: disturbed. How did nobody at the studio notice these effects on Alita and immediately mandate reshoots that use just the actress' real face instead of this uncanny valley monstrosity? \n\nSebastian Dietz - Hey John, like always greetings from germany ;) in my opinion one of the first things disney should do after buying fox‚Äòs assets is split the production auf Avatar 2 and 3. (Yes i‚Äôm in the doubting J. Cameron business ;)) If Avatar 2 fails (and i think there are huge arguments that it could) it‚Äôs a big risk to already have spend the money on the production of the 3rd one. Much like the situation of JL and Aquaman. Thoughts?\nBryan K - If DC and WB offered Kevin Feige a huge pay bump to jump ship to build their DCU do you think Kevin would go and would you want him to? Kevin has already done so much for Marvel he may won't a new challenge and fresh start?\n\n**DC logo art by Piebytwo",could kevin feige save dc alita battle angel look great terrible john campea show,episode john campea show recorded saturday december 9th 2017 john discusses following topicsnnsupport john patreon supporter jacob bullard think tarantinos association regardless films quality hamper next trek films financial success django tarantinos record made 425mil fear many people especially families avoid assumptions drawn tarantinos past films even general audience knows movies extreme average rrated films nnmathew garet kind random question find odd ja bayona isnt one announcing trailers social media actually colin trevorrow appreciate everything john nnsamuel polay watched trailer alita battle angel reaction summed one word disturbed nobody studio notice effects alita immediately mandate reshoots use actress real face instead uncanny valley monstrosity nnsebastian dietz hey john like always greetings germany opinion one first things disney buying foxs assets split production auf avatar 2 3 yes im doubting j cameron business avatar 2 fails think huge arguments could big risk already spend money production 3rd one much like situation jl aquaman thoughtsnbryan k dc wb offered kevin feige huge pay bump jump ship build dcu think kevin would go would want kevin already done much marvel may wont new challenge fresh startnndc logo art piebytwo

S7kG641iA_g,Cardistry - Virtuoso : RISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck,"The new FW17 Virtuoso deck is launching soon. \nLearn more about this deck and Cardistry at https://thevirts.com/\nClick show more to learn about the video, deck, music and moves!\n\nA note from The Virts about RISE:\n\nIf there‚Äôs one thing we‚Äôve learned from shuffling cards over the past 14 years, it‚Äôs that you only get better at Cardistry as you repeatedly push yourself beyond your limits. The byproduct of that, of course, is dropping cards - again, and again, and again.\n\nToday, after 14 years... we still drop our cards all the time. Sure, we now drop our cards less frequently; but no matter how much better we‚Äôve gotten, bending to the floor and repeatedly picking cards up covered in dust (and hair) never gets any less frustrating. \n\nOver the years, we‚Äôve come to establish a bit of a love-hate relationship with failure. We still don‚Äôt like it, yet we‚Äôve also come to recognize that if we‚Äôre not dropping our cards enough, we‚Äôre also not going to get any better at Cardistry. And in that sense, we‚Äôve come to find failure rather beautiful. \n\nRISE was birthed from a vision of ours to capture this intriguing beauty of failure.\n\nEnvisioning a juxtaposition between clean forms and abstract swirls, we pictured cards being manipulated with impeccable technique - abruptly interrupted and exploding out of the very hands that shuffled them. \n\nWe imagined them rising from the ground; the cards fluttering through the air in slow motion, dancing like the leaves in the Fall... and returning to our hands - perhaps forming imperfectly at first, then progressing with each step taken, and finally, displayed in all their glory. \n\nYet our stubbornness as Cardists doubling as filmmakers resulted in a few interesting restrictions that we imposed upon ourselves: \n\nIf this ‚ÄúFall‚Äù vision were to be captured, it would have to be done with no CG. Everything had to be filmed in-camera and performed by ourselves with with a real deck of cards.\n\nNext, there would be no use of green screen, compositing, or other camera trickery. The furthest we agreed upon was the reversal of several scenes - and only if they genuinely added to the story we wanted to tell. \n\nAnd finally, the cards used could not be gimmicked in anyway - no strings, magnets or anything of the sort. If what we envisioned could not be accomplished by our technique, then the idea was scrapped. \n\nThankfully, after months of planning, testing, and of course...failing, we finally had the opportunity to transform our vision into a reality. \n\nThrough the use of a Phantom high-speed camera mounted on a Bolt Cinebot (thank you Shooting Gallery Asia), and the help of a leaf blower or two... Rise was born. \n\nWe truly hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it for you. \n\n- The Virts\n\n---\n\nRISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck\nCredits:\nhttps://youtu.be/S7kG641iA_g\n\nCardistry Credits:\nCardistry performed by Virtuoso (The Virts):\nHuron Low \nKevin Ho \nDaren Yeow\n\nCardistry and Card flourish move list (in order shown):\n \nIndice Fans (classic)\nAnaconda by Bone Ho\nStairmaster by Kevin Ho (credit to Birger Karlsson and Kenneth Aidan Foo)\nNinja Spring Grab + Replacement by Virtuoso\nFlicker by Huron Low  + Rev 2 Twirl by Daren Yeow\nFlicker Shot Behind the Back by Huron Low\nV Cascade by Daren Yeow\nAerial Combo Sequence by Huron Low (Kick Cut Flip, V Flip, by Huron Low, Railslide Flip, Aerial Cut by Dan and Dave Buck)\nBuzzsaw by Brendan Conner\nAnaconda by Bone Ho\nMind Eraser by Kevin Ho (credit to Chris Kenner and Huron Low)\nSatellite by Kevin Ho\nTornado Deck Split by Kevin Ho (credit to Bone Ho)\nPiano Cuts by Andrew Avila\nYo!

When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.

IC_lnyn2R2Q,THE 15:17 TO PARIS - Official Trailer [HD],"From Clint Eastwood comes The 15:17 to Paris - in theaters February 9.\n\nhttp://www.1517toparis.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/1517toparis\nhttps://twitter.com/1517toParis\nhttps://www.instagram.com/1517toparis\n\n--\n\nFrom Clint Eastwood comes ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris,‚Äù which tells the real-life story of three men whose brave act turned them into heroes during a highspeed railway ride.\n\nIn the early evening of August 21, 2015, the world watched in stunned silence as the media reported a thwarted terrorist attack on Thalys train #9364 bound for Paris‚Äîan attempt prevented by three courageous young Americans traveling through Europe.  The film follows the course of the friends‚Äô lives, from the struggles of childhood through finding their footing in life, to the series of unlikely events leading up to the attack.  Throughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.\n\nThe heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.  Starring alongside them are Jenna Fischer (‚ÄúHall Pass,‚Äù TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù); Judy Greer (‚ÄúWar for the Planet of the Apes‚Äù); Ray Corasani (TV‚Äôs upcoming ‚ÄúThe Long Road Home‚Äù); PJ Byrne (‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street‚Äù); Tony Hale (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúVeep‚Äù); and Thomas Lennon (‚ÄúTransformers: Age of Extinction‚Äù).  Paul-Mik√©l Williams plays the younger Anthony, Bryce Gheisar plays the younger Alek, and William Jennings plays the younger Spencer.\n\nEastwood (‚ÄúSully,‚Äù ‚ÄúAmerican Sniper‚Äù) directs from a screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the book by Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Jeffrey E. Stern.  Eastwood also produces the film, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier.  The film‚Äôs executive producer is Bruce Berman.\n\nBehind the scenes, the creative team includes frequent collaborators Tom Stern, who served as cinematographer on 13 of Eastwood‚Äôs previous films, and Deborah Hopper, who has served as Eastwood‚Äôs costume designer on 17 prior films; editor Blu Murray, who most recently cut ‚ÄúSully,‚Äù and that film‚Äôs composer, Christian Jacob.  Veteran art director Kevin Ishioka, whose work can be seen in ‚ÄúSully‚Äù and in ‚ÄúDunkirk,‚Äù serves as production designer.\n\nWarner Bros.

In an interview with Variety at the Dubai International Film Festival, David Harbour ‚Äì aka Chief Jim Hopper ‚Äì revealed that the third season of the hit sci-fi series probably won‚Äôt hit Netflix until 2019! It‚Äôs not even 2018 now. That means we might have to wait more than a year to get the goods of season 3.\n\nAs soon as those words came out of his mouth the internet went into a frenzy, with fans around the globe tweeting angry gifs with the text ‚ÄúWhen you realize you have to wait until 2013 for season 3 of stranger things.‚Äù Now, the good news is that while we impatiently wait, the Duffer brothers responsible for those amazing scripts are working hard to create an unforgettable third season. \n\nChief Hopper even revealed that the writers basically just sit in their apartments day in and day out for like 12-14 hours a day and just WRITE. And we thank you for your service. On another note, the weekend that Stranger Things was released gave Netflix its biggest streaming day in the UK in all of 2017. By Sunday, October 29th, many fans had literally binged the entire second season in under 24 hours. \n\nLet‚Äôs learn our lesson and take our time in season 3. But I want to hear from you: how you feeling that we might have to wait like a thousand years for the next season. Between the wait time for Game of Thrones and now Stranger Things, I might just give up on TV altogether. It‚Äôs becoming so cruel!

1UPJ_Uk9s5c,Black Panther: New International Trailer Released - Movie Talk,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday December 12th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff, Jared Haibon, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) Hugh Jackman rules out a return as Wolverine if Disney/Fox merger happens; Disney/Fox deal nears finish line as Comcast withdraws\n\n2) ‚ÄòCreed 2‚Äô Lands Director Steven Caple Jr.; Stallone Sits Out This Round\n\n3) Opening This Week ‚Äì Star Wars the Last Jedi \n\n4) Seth Rogen to Go Dramatic as Walter Cronkite in JFK Assassination Film ‚ÄòNewsflash‚Äô\n\n5) ‚ÄòBlack Panther‚Äô: New International Trailer Released Online \n\n6) Mail Bag \n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nVariety has updated the status of the proposed Disney/Fox merger and is now reporting that the Mouse House has such an inside track on a $60 billion-plus agreement that Comcast has formally exited the deal. While implications for the merger remain foggy, one thing most fans want to see is the Fantastic Four and the X-Men return to the MCU ‚Äì and especially ‚Äì if it‚Äôs enough to lure Hugh Jackman out of retirement. \n\nVariety reports that MGM and Warner Bros. have hired up-and-coming director Steven Caple Jr. to direct Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone and Tessa Thompson in Creed 2. It was previously reported that Stallone had considered directing sequel at one point, but after talking it over with Jordan and the execs, made the decision to find another director and after a lengthy search, both Jordan and Stallone personally picked Caple to take the reins. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nDeadline reports that Seth Rogen has signed on to play legendary CBS newsman Walter Cronkite in the upcoming drama Newsflash, directed by his Pineapple Express director David Gordon Green. The drama takes place on November 22, 1963, the day of President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs assassination, unfolding in real time as Cronkite and his producer Don Hewitt attempt to report on one of the biggest news stories in history. \n\nA new international trailer from Japan has landed online for Black Panther and it features even more unseen footage of the advanced weaponry utilized by the people of Wakanda. The movie stars Chadwick Boseman as T‚ÄôChalla, who must stand against a powerful old enemy who reappears after years hidden in order to defend the throne and save his people. Black Panther is the next entry in the MCU and opens in theaters on February 16, 2018.\n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Jared: https://twitter.com/haibon_jared\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",black panther new international trailer released movie talk,episode collider movie talk tuesday december 12th 2017 mark ellis jon schnepp kristian harloff jared haibon ashley mova discuss following nn1 hugh jackman rules return wolverine disneyfox merger happens disneyfox deal nears finish line comcast withdrawsnn2 creed 2 lands director steven caple jr stallone sits roundnn3 opening week star wars last jedi nn4 seth rogen go dramatic walter cronkite jfk assassination film newsflashnn5 black panther new international trailer released online nn6 mail bag nn7 live twitter questionsnnvariety updated status proposed disneyfox merger reporting mouse house inside track 60 billionplus agreement comcast formally exited deal implications merger remain foggy one thing fans want see fantastic four xmen return mcu especially enough lure hugh jackman retirement nnvariety reports mgm warner bros hired upandcoming director steven caple jr direct michael b jordan sylvester stallone tessa thompson creed 2 previously reported stallone considered directing sequel one point talking jordan execs made decision find another director lengthy search jordan stallone personally picked caple take reins nnopening weeknndeadline reports seth rogen signed play legendary cbs newsman walter cronkite upcoming drama newsflash directed pineapple express director david gordon green drama takes place november 22 1963 day president john f kennedys assassination unfolding real time cronkite producer hewitt attempt report one biggest news stories history nna new international trailer japan landed online black panther features even unseen footage advanced weaponry utilized people wakanda movie stars chadwick boseman tchalla must stand powerful old enemy reappears years hidden order defend throne save people black panther next entry mcu opens theaters february 16 2018nnmail bagnnlive twitter questionsnncheck youtube playlist awesometacular us twitter us instagram us facebook mark kristian schnepp jared ashley online source movies television breaking news incisive content imminent trends collider videos essential destinationnnvisit collider twitter schmoes youtube channel show schedulennmonday tv talk nntuesday heroes schmoedown nnwednesday nightmares nnthursday jedi council nnfriday schmoedown nnsaturday mailbag nnbehind scenesbloopers mailbag talk every week day

DON'T GIVE UP HOPE - more research will be done, there are other options you haven't tried yet, you will feel present again one day - but just in case that day doesn't come/it takes a while, you might as well enjoy life as best as you can whilst feeling spaced out!\n\nLast year I could barely talk to people I was that spaced out! I didn't want to leave my flat for fear my existence would be snuffed out it felt so fragile. But now I wake up and although I still am living in this weird dreamlike world, I can function and make an impression on the world, despite barely feeling like I'm in it.\n\nIt will be okay!

XXXqaYls50o,Riverdale | Chapter Twenty-Three: The Blackboard Jungle Trailer | The CW,"Riverdale is new Wednesdays at 8/7c only on The CW, and available next day on The CW App: http://go.cwtv.com/genRVRyt\n \nSUBSCRIBE: http://go.cwtv.com/YTSubscribe\n \nAbout RIVERDALE:\nAs a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom ‚Äî and nothing feels the same. Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer‚Äôs events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale‚Äôs young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It‚Äôs all weighing heavily on Archie‚Äôs mind ‚Äî as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she‚Äôs not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty‚Äôs nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (M√§dchen Amick), aren‚Äôt the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there‚Äôs an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn‚Äôt want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there‚Äôs Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale‚Äôs Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own.

On the Season Four premiere, Lucious makes his first public appearance after the explosion in Las Vegas, while all members of the Lyon family have their own interests in Lucious regaining his physical and mental faculties. Academy Award- and Golden Globe-winning actor, director and producer Forest Whitaker (‚ÄúThe Last King of Scotland,‚Äù ‚ÄúArrival,‚Äù ‚ÄúLee Daniels‚Äô The Butler‚Äù) will guest-star in a multi-episode arc on EMPIRE, beginning this fall on FOX. Whitaker will play ‚ÄúUncle Eddie,‚Äù a charismatic music icon and bonafide hitmaker, who gave an unknown Lucious (Terrence Howard) his first radio airplay. Decades later, Eddie steps up for Lucious at a critical moment during his rehabilitation, and a grateful Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) invites him to produce a song in celebration of Empire Entertainment‚Äôs 20th anniversary.\n\nEMPIRE is a powerful drama about a family dynasty set within the glamorous and sometimes dangerous world of hip-hop music. The show revolves around the Lyon family and their media company, Empire Entertainment. The founder, LUCIOUS LYON (Terrence Howard), is the king of hip-hop, but his company and reign are constantly threatened by his family, including his ex-wife, COOKIE LYON (Taraji P. Henson); his sons, JAMAL (Jussie Smollett), HAKEEM (Bryshere ‚ÄúYazz‚Äù Gray) and ANDRE (Trai Byers); and a volatile and competitive music industry.\n\n‚ÄúSanta Baby‚Äù ft.

BBQ-2BUGQv8,Star Wars: The Last Jedi Has Second Largest Opening Ever Amidst Mixed Fan Reactions - Movie Talk,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Monday December 18th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) Star Wars: The Last Jedi' Delivers Second Largest Opening Ever; Fans Split on Rotten Tomatoes\n\n2) Box Office Report\n\n3) Oscar Isaac in Talks to Voice Gomez Addams in Animated ‚ÄòAddams Family‚Äô Movie\n\n4) '48 Hrs.' Remake in the Works With 'Good Time' Filmmakers\n\n5) ‚ÄòLaddie‚Äô Trailer: Meet The Man Who Made ‚ÄòStar Wars‚Äô Possible\n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi delivered on expectations, debuting over the weekend with the second largest opening of all-time, behind only Star Wars The Force Awakens. With an estimated $220 million, The Last Jedi got off to a strong start on Thursday night with the second largest preview ever with $45 million and became the second film to ever gross over $100 million on opening day. Audiences also gave the film an A CinemaScore, matching the score for Force Awakens, however; the Rotten Tomatoes audience score for Last Jedi is currently 56% vs. a 93% score from critics ‚Äì with an increasing backlash happening online between those fans who enjoyed the movie and those who did not.  \n\nBOX OFFICE REPORT\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nAccording to a report from The Tracking Board, Oscar Isaac has been cast as the voice of Gomez Addams in the animated The Addams Family movie for Sausage Party director Conrad Vernan. The roles of Morticia, Wednesday, Pugsley, Lurch and Uncle Fester have yet to be filled, apparently because the studio wants to close a deal with Isaac before approaching anyone else.\n\nTHR reports that Benny and Josh Safdie, the brother filmmaking team behind the Robert Pattinson thriller Good Time, will take on a remake of 48 Hrs. for Paramount Pictures. 48 Hrs. is the classic comedy that helped launch the big-screen career of Eddie Murphy, as well as the buddy-cop genre. Murphy and Nick Nolte starred as a convict and cop, who must team up to catch a pair of killers within 48 hours. A release date has not been determined. \n\nStar Wars Underworld found and posted the first trailer for ‚ÄòLaddie,‚Äù the documentary about Alan Ladd Jr, AKA Laddie, the man at 20th Century Fox who gave George Lucas the greenlight and freedom to make Star Wars back in 1977.  The documentary dives into Ladd as an agent, producer, executive, and studio head, where he worked on movies ranging from Alien to Young Frankenstein to Star Wars over the course of his long, storied career. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO",star wars last jedi second largest opening ever amidst mixed fan reactions movie talk,episode collider movie talk monday december 18th 2017 mark ellis jon schnepp kristian harloff ashley mova discuss following nn1 star wars last jedi delivers second largest opening ever fans split rotten tomatoesnn2 box office reportnn3 oscar isaac talks voice gomez addams animated addams family movienn4 48 hrs remake works good time filmmakersnn5 laddie trailer meet man made star wars possiblenn6 mail bagnn7 live twitter questionsnnstar wars last jedi delivered expectations debuting weekend second largest opening alltime behind star wars force awakens estimated 220 million last jedi got strong start thursday night second largest preview ever 45 million became second film ever gross 100 million opening day audiences also gave film cinemascore matching score force awakens however rotten tomatoes audience score last jedi currently 56 vs 93 score critics increasing backlash happening online fans enjoyed movie nnbox office reportnnbuy sellnnaccording report tracking board oscar isaac cast voice gomez addams animated addams family movie sausage party director conrad vernan roles morticia wednesday pugsley lurch uncle fester yet filled apparently studio wants close deal isaac approaching anyone elsennthr reports benny josh safdie brother filmmaking team behind robert pattinson thriller good time take remake 48 hrs paramount pictures 48 hrs classic comedy helped launch bigscreen career eddie murphy well buddycop genre murphy nick nolte starred convict cop must team catch pair killers within 48 hours release date determined nnstar wars underworld found posted first trailer laddie documentary alan ladd jr aka laddie man 20th century fox gave george lucas greenlight freedom make star wars back 1977 documentary dives ladd agent producer executive studio head worked movies ranging alien young frankenstein star wars course long storied career nnmail bagnnlive twitter questionsnncheck youtube playlist awesometacular us twitter us instagram us facebook mark kristian schnepp ashley online source movies television breaking news incisive content imminent trends collider videos essential destinationnnvisit collider twitter schmoes youtube channel show schedulennmonday tv talk nntuesday heroes schmoedown nnwednesday nightmares nnthursday jedi council nnfriday schmoedown nnsaturday mailbag nnbehind scenesbloopers mailbag talk every week day

Bn02bclCu5A,Star Wars Episode IX Story Pitched By JJ Abrams - Movie Talk,"On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Tuesday, December 19th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Jon Schnepp, Perri Nemiroff, Ashley Mova discuss the following:  \n\n1) J.J. Abrams Just Pitched His Star Wars: Episode IX to Disney\n\n2) Third ‚ÄòGI Joe‚Äô Gets Official 2020 Release Date; Paramount also dates Micronauts and Dungeons & Dragons\n\n3) Opening This Week ‚Äì Pitch Perfect 3\n\n4) Director Matthew Vaughn Confirms Talks with DC\n\n‚ÄúI do love the world of DC, and I‚Äôve been talking to them at the moment about a few things. It‚Äôs more fun getting involved with franchises when they‚Äôre on the down, because then it‚Äôs easier to make a good film. So if I got involved with a few of the superhero films out there that have been disappointing, it‚Äôs going to be‚Ä¶ if I do OK, it‚Äôll probably be better.‚Äù\n\n5) First ‚ÄòOcean‚Äôs 8‚Ä≤ Trailer \n\n6) Mail Bag\n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nJust as Star Wars The Last Jedi was gearing up to debut in theatres, work on Episode 9 started its journey into pre-production. Via a report from Making Star Wars, during the press conference for the recent Disney/Fox merger, Disney CEO Bob Iger revealed that JJ Abrams would be pitching his Star Wars to the studio on December 15th, the day The Last Jedi hit theatres. Fantha Tracks also revealed that Abrams‚Äô film would be made with the working title ‚ÄúBlack Diamond.‚Äù The working title for Force Awakens was ‚ÄúAVCO‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpace Bear‚Äù for Last Jedi. Star Wars Episode 9 is scheduled to hit theatres on December 20th, 2019. \n\nYesterday, Paramount Pictures officially announced plans for a third GI Joe movie and dated it to be released on March 27, 2020. Titled simply GI Joe, the plan for the movie is unknown at this time, as is casting and who will be taking on directing duties. Paramount also dated a feature adaptation of the late ‚Äô70s Mego/Takara toyline Micronauts for Oct. 16, 2020, with J.J. Abrams‚Äô Bad Robot behind the production. \n\nOPENING THIS WEEK\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a recent podcast from IGN UK, director Matthew Vaughn confirmed he‚Äôs had talks with DC and is interested in helping out the studio after the not-so-stellar performance of Justice League cast more speculation as to what is happening behind closed doors over at DC. \n\nWarner Bros. has released the first Ocean‚Äôs 8 trailer for the upcoming spinoff from Steven Soderbergh‚Äôs Ocean‚Äôs trilogy. Hunger Games filmmaker Gary Ross directs the new film, which stars Sandra Bullock as Debbie Ocean, the sister of George Clooney‚Äôs Danny Ocean.

Share this Christmas card with someone you love! üíï ‚ñ∫http://bit.ly/2BUEGVb\nThis project spells out Merry Christmas in 7,000 dominoes and incorporates various Christmas-related objects including ornaments, Santa, a mistletoe, and Christmas lights :)\n\nWatch my other Christmas domino specials here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn0dmj1AovU&list=PLNPDtUHUkSPb-IZVGtuQGkYM5L6aOkevw&index=1\n\nFor a while I've wanted to try building large fancy font freehanded out of dominoes, so I decided to build Merry Christmas in cursive :) I wanted to test my skills in recreating an image out of dominoes by eyeing it. Lettering is always a challenge to build in dominoes based off a picture because you have to be extremely precise to make the font look right (here's the original picture: http://bit.ly/2DylugC). Lots of proportions, measuring, and eye-balling were needed for this project. It was also a challenge to figure out how to get this to topple sequentially by letter, since everything was connected in cursive (however, sometimes not in the direction it needed to topple). I had to tape down a few one way dominoes to ensure that the path would keep going in the right direction. Overall, this was a fun project to do and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed building it :)\n\nWATCH MORE DOMINO VIDEOS HERE! üòä\n‚óèYOUTUBERS in dominoes ‚û°Ô∏è http://bit.ly/2uRzTDf\n‚óèMy BEST domino projects ‚û°Ô∏è http://bit.ly/2swnIWN\n‚óèVideo games/movies in dominoes ‚û°Ô∏è http://bit.ly/2u8tZdx\n\nHey!

You have talked before about how Netflix won't be hurt to much by Disney taking it's properties off Netflix. But with the Disney/Fox deal it's safe to assume that a similar thing will happen with all the newly acquired Fox properties. Two major company taking content off Netflix is a lot more significant than if just one did. \n\nMelissa Ramirez  - Looks like the sequel to Alien Covenent got cancelled just like you said it would. But really, is it any surprise? The last film did so badly, why did anyone still think a new one would happen?\n\nJacob Hickey - The box office results of Blade Runner 2019 has to rank amongst the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2017. Such a great movie, such a sad result. Ridley Scott is saying that the reason is did badly was the long running time. Do you agree with him?\n\nDion Debord - Hey John. Hope you‚Äôre having a great holiday season! With the debate going on about The Last Jedi, Mark Hamill has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the film. My question is, even if all film is subjective, if Luke Skywalker himself says the movie isn‚Äôt good, how can anyone still defend it?\n\nIntothefuture - Q: I have been looking forward to the Han Solo film coming out sometime i‚Äôm 2018. I thought with Ron Howard coming in that all would be forgiven and or saved? Do you think this movie has a chance? Reports are saying Disney has no faith.

Equal parts family history, dynastic saga and an examination of the corrosive power of money, Trust explores the complexities at the heart of every family, rich or poor.  \n\nTold over multiple seasons and spanning the twentieth century, the series begins in 1973 with the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Harris Dickinson), an heir to the Getty oil fortune, by the Italian mafia in Rome. His captors banked on a multi-million-dollar ransom. After all, what rich family wouldn‚Äôt pay for the return of a loved one? \nPaul‚Äôs grandfather, J. Paul Getty (Donald Sutherland), an enigmatic oil tycoon and possibly the richest man in the world, is marooned in a Tudor mansion in the English countryside surrounded by a harem of mistresses and a pet lion. He‚Äôs busy. Paul‚Äôs father, J. Paul Getty Jr. (Michael Esper), is lost in a daze in London and refuses to answer the phone. Only Paul‚Äôs mother, Gail Getty (Hilary Swank), is left to negotiate with the increasingly desperate kidnappers. Unfortunately, she‚Äôs broke. Trust charts the teenage grandson‚Äôs nightmare ordeal at the hands of kidnappers who cannot understand why nobody seems to want their captive back.\n\nThe cast also includes Brendan Fraser, Anna Chancellor, Norbert Leo Butz, Charlotte Riley and Luca Marinelli.\n\nTrust is created by Simon Beaufoy. Danny Boyle has directed the first three episodes. Executive Producers are Christian Colson, Beaufoy and Boyle.

WmYCUljsrDg,Log Cabin TIMELAPSE Built By ONE MAN In The Forest (Real Life Minecraft),"Timelapse video of a complete log cabin build by one man alone in the wilderness of Canada, from 1st tree I cut to last floor board I laid. If you want to build a rustic log cabin or tiny off grid home alone in the wilderness and you haven't seen the rest of my videos, this is a good primer. It's super fast motion though, so if you are interested in building a primitive log cabin like this, take a look at the Log Cabin The Bear Den playlist on the channel.\nAt the beginning of the video, I show a winter drone photo of the cabin in the snow in December. Then I flashback to the first balsam fir tree I cut down with a saw and axe near the cabin. I drag the trees into place and clear the cabin site. All summer, I cut the notches in the logs as I built the cabin up, offsite. Once I was finished notching the logs with a log scribe, saw, axe, adze and wood carving gouge, I loaded up the entire cabin of logs and moved them to my land near Algonquin Park, Ontario Canada.\nOnce on site, I spent a month reassembling the cabin on a foundation of sand and gravel. Once the log walls were up, I again used hand tools to shape every log, board and timber to erect the gable ends, the wood roof, the porch, the outhouse and a seemingly endless number of woodworking projects.\nFor the roof, I used an ancient primitive technology to waterproof and preserve the wood - shou sugi ban, a fire hardening wood preservation technique unique to Japan and other areas in northern climates.\nBecause the cabin is offgrid, I have used handtools for most of the build and without power, I have no options on site regardless. The tiny house will continue to be operated with power, not even renewable energy for now, so I'm heating the cabin with a woodstove fire place, which I also cook on.\nThe cabin is made of cedar fence posts, twelve feet long and the cabin measures 10 feet x 20 feet inside with a one hundred square foot sleeping loft on the second floor.\nThe floor is made of two inch thick pine planks, torched to help repel water and to give them a rustic barn board appearance.\n\nTune off sound if you don't want to hear the music, - there is no talking in this silent video. If you are a subscriber or long time viewer, there is some new footage at the end of the video, but otherwise you have seen most of this. As always, I'll release a new video on Friday showing the progress I made this week on the door and the ice box for food storage.\n\nTo see what I‚Äôm up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) ‚Äì https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram ‚Äì https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMusic \nEternal Hope by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100238\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",log cabin timelapse built one man forest real life minecraft,timelapse video complete log cabin build one man alone wilderness canada 1st tree cut last floor board laid want build rustic log cabin tiny grid home alone wilderness havent seen rest videos good primer super fast motion though interested building primitive log cabin like take look log cabin bear den playlist channelnat beginning video show winter drone photo cabin snow december flashback first balsam fir tree cut saw axe near cabin drag trees place clear cabin site summer cut notches logs built cabin offsite finished notching logs log scribe saw axe adze wood carving gouge loaded entire cabin logs moved land near algonquin park ontario canadanonce site spent month reassembling cabin foundation sand gravel log walls used hand tools shape every log board timber erect gable ends wood roof porch outhouse seemingly endless number woodworking projectsnfor roof used ancient primitive technology waterproof preserve wood shou sugi ban fire hardening wood preservation technique unique japan areas northern climatesnbecause cabin offgrid used handtools build without power options site regardless tiny house continue operated power even renewable energy im heating cabin woodstove fire place also cook onnthe cabin made cedar fence posts twelve feet long cabin measures 10 feet x 20 feet inside one hundred square foot sleeping loft second floornthe floor made two inch thick pine planks torched help repel water give rustic barn board appearancenntune sound dont want hear music talking silent video subscriber long time viewer new footage end video otherwise seen always ill release new video friday showing progress made week door ice box food storagennto see im rest week please follow online channelsnnwebsite facebook page shawn james neternal hope kevin macleod licensed creative commons attribution license

Interestingly enough, the studio initially asked Ben Affleck to return to the director‚Äôs chair, but he eventually passed. This comes as Warner Bros. begins reshuffling its D.C. properties, with New Line exec Walter Hamada recently promoted to oversee its comic book movies. \n\nDisney has released the first official synopsis for Solo: A Star Wars Story, the major new Star Wars movie that‚Äôs coming out in a little over four months. As part of Disney‚Äôs 2018 preview kit, the synopsis seems to tease the release of the first trailer, which should be coming any day now.\n\nAGREE OR DISAGREE\n\nAmazon Studios has released the first trailer for Don‚Äôt Worry, He Won‚Äôt Get Far on Foot.

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù stars Tye Sheridan (‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse,‚Äù ‚ÄúMud‚Äù), Olivia Cooke (‚ÄúMe and Earl and the Dying Girl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBates Motel‚Äù), Ben Mendelsohn (‚ÄúRogue One ‚Äì A Star Wars Story,‚Äù ‚ÄúBloodline‚Äù) and T.J. Miller (‚ÄúDeadpool,‚Äù ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù), with Simon Pegg (the ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù movies, the ‚ÄúMission: Impossible‚Äù movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (‚ÄúBridge of Spies,‚Äù ‚ÄúDunkirk‚Äù).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan‚Äù) reunited his creative team from ‚ÄúBridge of Spies,‚Äù including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (‚ÄúSchindler‚Äôs List,‚Äù ‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan‚Äù), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (‚ÄúThe Grand Budapest Hotel‚Äù), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (‚ÄúSaving Private Ryan,‚Äù ‚ÄúRaiders of the Lost Ark‚Äù) and Sarah Broshar (‚ÄúThe Post‚Äù), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (‚ÄúMoonrise Kingdom‚Äù).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù films, ‚ÄúForrest Gump‚Äù).\n\nWarner Bros.

JrFiNSueT3Y,10 BEST Moments From 2018 SAG Awards,"More Celebrity News ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nFirst and foremost, our hats go off to Mr. Morgan Freeman also known as the man I hope to narrate my life story one day. He was honored tonight with the Lifetime Achievement Award. \nMorgan‚Äôs good friend, Rita Moreno presented him with the prestigious award and the display of their friendship was beyond adorable. Morgan was sure to thank her along with his family and friends who flew out to celebrate with him as well as his peers in the room. Then Morgan took a moment to point out the fact that the SAG award statue, known as the Actor has a bit of a bias to it. \nYou gotta love Morgan Freeman. Another person you can‚Äôt help but to love is Sterling K. Brown. He won best male actor in a drama series for his role on This Is Us making history once again becoming the first black man to win in that category. \nSterling also thanked his peers in the room and his beautiful wife who had the sweetest most adorable reaction to his winning streak continuing.  \nWhen the camera panned to Ryan‚Äôs face while Sterling was giving his speech, she was literally shaking with pride and happiness. \nWhich brings me to yet another moving moment during the show. Nicole Kidman won her first SAG award tonight for best Female Actor in a television Movie or Limited Series for her work  in Big Little Lies. She got choked up noting that winning means so much to her because she has been acting since she was 14 years old. \nShe went on to thank her co-stars, fellow nominees and female actors who have inspired her and paved the way for her career. \nShe continued saying - We've proven ‚Äî and these actresses and so many more have proven ‚Äî we are potent and powerful and viable. I just beg that the industry stays behind us because our stories are finally being told. It's only the beginning.\n\n\nFor More Clevver Visit:\nThere are 2 types of people: those who follow us on Facebook and those who are missing out http://facebook.com/clevver\n\nKeep up with us on Instagram: http://instagr.am/Clevver\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ClevverTV\nWebsite: http://www.clevver.com \n\n\nAdd us to your circles on Google+: http://google.com/+ClevverNews\nTweet Me: http://www.twitter.com/Drew__dorsey",10 best moments 2018 sag awards,celebrity news foremost hats go mr morgan freeman also known man hope narrate life story one day honored tonight lifetime achievement award nmorgans good friend rita moreno presented prestigious award display friendship beyond adorable morgan sure thank along family friends flew celebrate well peers room morgan took moment point fact sag award statue known actor bit bias nyou gotta love morgan freeman another person cant help love sterling k brown best male actor drama series role us making history becoming first black man win category nsterling also thanked peers room beautiful wife sweetest adorable reaction winning streak continuing nwhen camera panned ryans face sterling giving speech literally shaking pride happiness nwhich brings yet another moving moment show nicole kidman first sag award tonight best female actor television movie limited series work big little lies got choked noting winning means much acting since 14 years old nshe went thank costars fellow nominees female actors inspired paved way career nshe continued saying weve proven actresses many proven potent powerful viable beg industry stays behind us stories finally told beginningnnnfor clevver visitnthere 2 types people follow us facebook missing us instagram us twitter nnnadd us circles google

It was actually his first ever time performing at the annual awards ceremony and let‚Äôs just say he did not disappoint. Looking handsome as ever in an all white suit, he absolutely crushed the performance of his stand-alone track ‚ÄòTerrified,‚Äô off his nominated album ‚ÄòAwaken, My Love.‚Äô\nNot only did he melt our hearts with that voice, he then completely surprised us by bringing JD McCrary up on stage to sing with him. Who, also sung like an actual angel.\nTonight felt like a preview of what‚Äôs to come, since Donald Glover and JD will actually be starring in a movie together, as they both are set to be in the Live-Action Lion King film.  JD will be voicing Young Simba and Donald will be voicing older Simba. And after this performance, we completely understand the casting choice.  \nThis was definitely a big night for Childish Gambino. In case that performance wasn‚Äôt enough, his track ‚ÄòRedbone‚Äô just won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance.\nBut right now I wanna turn it over to you guys. What did you think of Childish Gambino‚Äôs performance?

jjRXuZkeGRA,Riverdale | Chapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart Trailer | The CW,"Riverdale is new Wednesdays at 8/7c only on The CW, and available next day on The CW App: http://go.cwtv.com/genRVRyt\n \nSUBSCRIBE: http://go.cwtv.com/YTSubscribe\n \nAbout RIVERDALE:\nAs a new school year begins, the town of Riverdale is reeling from the recent, tragic death of high school golden boy Jason Blossom ‚Äî and nothing feels the same. Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) is still the all-American teen, but the summer‚Äôs events made him realize that he wants to pursue a career in music and not follow in his dad‚Äôs footsteps despite the sudden end of his forbidden relationship with Riverdale‚Äôs young music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel). Now Archie has no one to mentor him, certainly not singer Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), who is only focused on her band, the soon-to-be-world-famous Pussycats. It‚Äôs all weighing heavily on Archie‚Äôs mind ‚Äî as is his fractured friendship with budding writer and fellow classmate Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse). \n\nMeanwhile, girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) is anxious to see her crush Archie after being away all summer, but she‚Äôs not quite ready to reveal her true feelings to him. And Betty‚Äôs nerves, which are hardly soothed by her overbearing mother Alice (M√§dchen Amick), aren‚Äôt the only thing holding her back. When a new student, Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), arrives in town from New York with her mother Hermione (Marisol Nichols), there‚Äôs an undeniable spark between Veronica and Archie, even though Veronica doesn‚Äôt want to risk her new friendship with Betty by making a play for Archie. And then there‚Äôs Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch)... Riverdale‚Äôs Queen Bee is happy to stir up trouble amongst Archie, Betty and Veronica, but Cheryl is keeping secrets of her own. What, exactly, is she hiding about the mysterious death of her twin brother, Jason? Riverdale may look like a quiet, sleepy town, but there are dangers in the shadows. \nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, RIVERDALE is from Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions, with executive producers Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúGlee‚Äù), Greg Berlanti (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù), Sarah Schechter (‚ÄúArrow,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù ‚ÄúSupergirl,‚Äù ‚ÄúDC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow‚Äù) and Jon Goldwater (Archie Comics).\n\nConnect with RIVERDALE Online:\nLearn more about RIVERDALE : http://cwtv.com/shows/riverdale\nLike RIVERDALE on FACEBOOK:https://www.facebook.com/CWRiverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/CW_Riverdale\nFollow RIVERDALE on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thecwriverdale/\n\nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as Black Lightning, Life Sentence, The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Dynasty, and Valor.\n\nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nRiverdale | Chapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart Trailer | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision",riverdale chapter twentysix telltale heart trailer cw,riverdale new wednesdays 87c cw available next day cw app nsubscribe nabout riverdalenas new school year begins town riverdale reeling recent tragic death high school golden boy jason blossom nothing feels archie andrews kj apa still allamerican teen summers events made realize wants pursue career music follow dads footsteps despite sudden end forbidden relationship riverdales young music teacher ms grundy sarah habel archie one mentor certainly singer josie mccoy ashleigh murray focused band soontobeworldfamous pussycats weighing heavily archies mind fractured friendship budding writer fellow classmate jughead jones cole sprouse nnmeanwhile girlnextdoor betty cooper lili reinhart anxious see crush archie away summer shes quite ready reveal true feelings bettys nerves hardly soothed overbearing mother alice m√§dchen amick arent thing holding back new student veronica lodge camila mendes arrives town new york mother hermione marisol nichols theres undeniable spark veronica archie even though veronica doesnt want risk new friendship betty making play archie theres cheryl blossom madelaine petsch riverdales queen bee happy stir trouble amongst archie betty veronica cheryl keeping secrets exactly hiding mysterious death twin brother jason riverdale may look like quiet sleepy town dangers shadows nbased characters archie comics riverdale warner bros television cbs television studios association berlanti productions executive producers roberto aguirresacasa supergirl glee greg berlanti arrow flash supergirl dcs legends tomorrow sarah schechter arrow flash supergirl dcs legends tomorrow jon goldwater archie comicsnnconnect riverdale onlinenlearn riverdale riverdale facebook riverdale twitter riverdale instagram cwnofficial youtube channel cw television network featuring hit series riverdale well black lightning life sentence flash arrow supergirl dcs legends tomorrow supernatural jane virgin crazy exgirlfriend originals 100 izombie dynasty valornnconnect cw onlinenvisit cw website cw facebook cw twitter nfollow cw instagram cw tumblr cw google cw pinterest nriverdale chapter twentysix telltale heart trailer cwn

Hmb0Q0Q_7jo,The blue marble,"After 3 months of work and probably more than 500 fails, I'm happy to present you my best video ever. \nSince magnets and marbles I've always wanted to make a big chain reaction in one take with this 2D style ! \n\nIt's also a one marble path which means you have to follow the same marble for all the tricks (in that case the little blue one.) Because everything is in a tilted plane, the hard part was to find different ways of having the marble riding up along the table (magnets, falling weight, catapult ...). To do that, the marble has to be light. And because everything has to be triggered by this little marble, all the tricks are very unstable. Most fails happened when an element fall down earlier than expected.\n\nI learned a lot about chain reaction, and I discovered the amazing power of the hot glue gun !",blue marble,3 months work probably 500 fails im happy present best video ever nsince magnets marbles ive always wanted make big chain reaction one take 2d style nnits also one marble path means follow marble tricks case little blue one everything tilted plane hard part find different ways marble riding along table magnets falling weight catapult marble light everything triggered little marble tricks unstable fails happened element fall earlier expectednni learned lot chain reaction discovered amazing power hot glue gun

Gilbert asks Eggert, Alexander says he witnessed this the first year of the show, which would make you 14? Eggert responds, 14-years-old, 1986 and before I was 15-years-old, he had me at his home, in his car, in his garage and he penetrated my vagina with his finger and this is where it began and this continued almost on a weekly basis for years. Of course, the abuse progressed from there quite a bit although I remained a virgin until I was 17.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

v3O9vNi-dkA,Hear the Otherworldly Sounds of Skating on Thin Ice | National Geographic,"This small lake outside Stockholm, Sweden, emits otherworldly sounds as M√•rten Ajne skates over its precariously thin, black ice. ‚ÄúWild ice skating,‚Äù or ‚ÄúNordic skating,‚Äù is both an art and a science. A skater seeks out the thinnest, most pristine black ice possible‚Äîboth for its smoothness, and for its high-pitched, laser-like sounds. \n‚û° Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Like a dome or arch, the support comes from the sides rather than the top, and the water underneath prevents the ice from breaking. But, experience and careful advance planning are key. Factors including temperature, atmospheric conditions, and even satellite images of the Earth‚Äôs surface are considered. It‚Äôs complicated, but appealing to mathematicians like Ajne. Even with preparation, there‚Äôs a risk of falling in‚Ä¶ So it‚Äôs best done in groups, for safety.\n\nRead about the science behind Nordic skating in How Skating on Thin Ice Creates Laser-Like Sounds\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/activities/winter-sports/skating-thin-black-ice-creates-sound-nordic-spd/\n\nHear the Otherworldly Sounds of Skating on Thin Ice | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/v3O9vNi-dkA\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo",hear otherworldly sounds skating thin ice national geographic,small lake outside stockholm sweden emits otherworldly sounds m√•rten ajne skates precariously thin black ice wild ice skating nordic skating art science skater seeks thinnest pristine black ice possibleboth smoothness highpitched laserlike sounds n subscribe national geographicnnational geographic worlds premium destination science exploration adventure worldclass scientists photographers journalists filmmakers nat geo gets closer stories matter past edge whats possiblennget national geographicnofficial site ice recently frozen thin 2 inches still support weight skater like dome arch support comes sides rather top water underneath prevents ice breaking experience careful advance planning key factors including temperature atmospheric conditions even satellite images earths surface considered complicated appealing mathematicians like ajne even preparation theres risk falling best done groups safetynnread science behind nordic skating skating thin ice creates laserlike soundsn otherworldly sounds skating thin ice national geographic n geographicn

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.

After that, for weeks on end, she was the most abusive homophobic, person I've ever met in my entire life..the absolutely last person you that you should ever allow, in my opinion, into the White House. About her recent revelations from her time in the administration, he says, The only thing she is less likely to get into bed with than me, is the truth...when she was in the White House, apparently, very divisive, causing trouble all the time, backstabbing people, achieving nothing..to me, it was a shocking lack of judgement by Donald Trump...Mr. Trump, you're supposed to be a winner.

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\n\nJesus Christ Superstar Live - John Legend Rehearses (Promo)\nhttps://youtu.be/-QR-TB_k20M\n\nNBC on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc",jesus christ superstar live john legend rehearses promo,harvey mason jr piano john legend rehearses role jesus tim rice andrew lloyd webbers jesus christ superstar live concert coming nbc easter sundayn subscribe get jesus christ superstar live watch full episodes free favorite shows socialnnbc youtube nbc nbc tumblr pinterest google instagram nbc trailers full episode highlights previews promos clips digital exclusives nnabout jesus christ superstar livenfrom executive producers andrew lloyd webber tim rice marc platt craig zadan neil meron comes nbcs next live musical spectacular groundbreaking rock opera jesus christ superstar live concert set final week jesus life story told perspective infamous betrayer judas iscariot followers flock jesus judas grows concerned jesus becoming arrogant losing sight principles jesus attacks money changers temple judas finally turns teacher setting path tragedy originally conceived concept album hit 1 billboard charts show eventually made way stage 1971 garnered five tony nominations addition winning drama desk award andrew lloyd webber globally celebrated classic comes nbc 2018 oneofakind live staging easter sunday thats sure amaze jawdropping spectacle allstar cast beloved recording artists fresh soundtrack featuring hits heaven minds dont know love superstarnnjesus christ superstar live john legend rehearses promon youtuben

zNL_kGO6lQ8,[ASMR] SLOW Tapping & Whispered Trigger Assortment,"Hello everyone!\nI have realized that as an ASMR fan, my trigger preferences often carry over to when I'm creating my own content.

The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl‚Äôs generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it‚Äôs a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award¬Æ nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who‚Äîa young girl overflowing with holiday cheer‚Äîplots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch‚Äôs more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos‚Äô holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.",grinch official trailer hd,grinch official trailernin theaters november 9n eighth fully animated feature illumination universal pictures present grinch based dr seuss beloved holiday classic grinch tells story cynical grump goes mission steal christmas heart changed young girls generous holiday spirit funny heartwarming visually stunning universal story spirit christmas indomitable power optimismn nacademy award nominee benedict cumberbatch lends voice infamous grinch lives solitary life inside cave mt crumpet loyal dog max company cave rigged inventions contraptions daytoday needs grinch sees neighbors whoville runs foodn neach year christmas disrupt tranquil solitude increasingly bigger brighter louder celebrations whos declare going make christmas three times bigger year grinch realizes one way gain peace quiet must steal christmas decides pose santa claus christmas eve even going far trap lackadaisical misfit reindeer pull sleighn nmeanwhile whoville cindylou whoa young girl overflowing holiday cheerplots gang friends trap santa claus makes christmas eve rounds thank help overworked single mother christmas approaches however goodnatured scheme threatens collide grinchs nefarious one cindylou achieve goal finally meeting santa claus grinch succeed silencing whos holiday cheer alln nfind christmas season 2018

Pictures‚Äô ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald‚Äù is the second of five all new adventures in J.K.

But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings.  \n\nIn an effort to thwart Grindelwald‚Äôs plans, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead.  Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.  \n\nThe film features an ensemble cast led by Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, with Jude Law and Johnny Depp.  The cast also includes, Zo√´ Kravitz, Callum Turner, Claudia Kim, William Nadylam, Kevin Guthrie, Carmen Ejogo, and  Poppy Corby-Tuech.\n\n‚ÄúFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald‚Äù is directed by David Yates, from a screenplay by J.K. Rowling.  The film is produced by David Heyman, J.K. Rowling, Steve Kloves and Lionel Wigram.  \n\nSlated for release on November 16, 2018, the film will be distributed worldwide in 2D and 3D in select theatres and IMAX by Warner Bros.

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends. Now, they will fight for the human race.\n \nConnect with THE 100 Online:\nVisit THE 100 WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/The100\nLike THE 100 on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/cwthe100\nFollow THE 100 on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/cwthe100\nFollow THE 100 on INSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/cw_the100\nFollow THE 100 on TUMBLR: http://cwthe100.tumblr.com\nFollow THE 100 on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw/the-100\n \nAbout The CW:\nOfficial YouTube Channel for the CW Television Network featuring the hit series Riverdale, as well as Black Lightning, Life Sentence, The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl, DC‚Äôs Legends of Tomorrow, Supernatural, Jane The Virgin, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The Originals, The 100, iZombie, Dynasty, and Valor.\n \nConnect with The CW Online:\nVisit The CW WEBSITE: http://on.cwtv.com/home\nLike The CW on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/thecw \nFollow The CW on INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/thecw\nFollow The CW on TUMBLR: http://cwnetwork.tumblr.com\nAdd The CW on GOOGLE+: http://plus.google.com/+thecw\nFollow The CW on PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/thecw\n \nThe 100 | Season 5 Official Extended Trailer | The CW\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CWtelevision",100 season 5 official extended trailer cw,100 returns tuesday april 24 cwn nsubscribe nabout 100nthe human race returns 97year exile space wildly transformed earthonly discover human race never truly left clarke found forced lead band disposable juvenile delinquents faced death every turn world transformed radiation fierce grounders somehow managed survive perhaps worst unfortunately newfound sense normalcy shortlived lives changed forever threats old new test loyalties push past limits make question truly means human first fought survive fought friends fight human racen nconnect 100 onlinenvisit 100 website 100 facebook 100 twitter 100 instagram 100 tumblr 100 pinterest nabout cwnofficial youtube channel cw television network featuring hit series riverdale well black lightning life sentence flash arrow supergirl dcs legends tomorrow supernatural jane virgin crazy exgirlfriend originals 100 izombie dynasty valorn nconnect cw onlinenvisit cw website cw facebook cw twitter nfollow cw instagram cw tumblr cw google cw pinterest nthe 100 season 5 official extended trailer cwn

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äù stars Tye Sheridan (‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse,‚Äù ‚ÄúMud‚Äù), Olivia Cooke (‚ÄúMe and Earl and the Dying Girl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBates Motel‚Äù), Ben Mendelsohn (‚ÄúRogue One ‚Äì A Star Wars Story,‚Äù ‚ÄúBloodline‚Äù) and T.J.

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).

RF-Mqs2qC-M,Inside Zedd's $16 Million Mansion That Has a Skittles Machine | Open Door | Architectural Digest,"In this episode of Open Door, Grammy-winning record producer and DJ Zedd gives an in-depth tour of his $16 million mansion in Benedict Canyon, an area of Los Angeles that's near Sherman Oaks and northwest of Beverly Hills. Zedd's self-decorated home is 9,500 square feet with views of the canyon and tons of full-length glass windows. \n\nThe house is structured into three sections: work, living, and sleep. The work section has Zedd's recording studio and an unfinished gym.\n\nThe driveway leads into the front entrance, which crosses a moat. \n\nA huge wall with cubbies holds art, awards, and silly memorabilia. For instance, Zedd's Grammy sits next to a poop emoji.\n\nAt the end of a corridor, before going outside, guests can pick their favorite flavor of the rainbow from the Skittles machine. \n\nZedd also has a server room and a Costco Room that contains just about anything he would need if he weren't able to leave the house for a long time.\n\nThe bathrooms feature automated blinds that can sometimes surprise the person taking the shower early in the morning.\n\nThe remote-controlled curtains in Zedd's bedroom make him the happiest of any feature in the house.\n\nOutside, the pool has a hidden jacuzzi / hot tub that's revealed when the pool's water level drops.\n\nThe kitchen has four built-in hibachi grills, a pot filler above the stovetop (which Zedd says is the reason he bought the house), and built-in vacuums.  \n\nStill haven‚Äôt subscribed to Architectural Digest on YouTube? ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/2zl7s34\n\nABOUT ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST\nThe leading international design authority, Architectural Digest features articles and videos of the best in architecture, style, culture, travel, and shopping.\n\nInside Zedd's $16 Million Mansion That Has a Skittles Machine | Open Door | Architectural Digest",inside zedds 16 million mansion skittles machine open door architectural digest,episode open door grammywinning record producer dj zedd gives indepth tour 16 million mansion benedict canyon area los angeles thats near sherman oaks northwest beverly hills zedds selfdecorated home 9500 square feet views canyon tons fulllength glass windows n nthe house structured three sections work living sleep work section zedds recording studio unfinished gym n nthe driveway leads front entrance crosses moat n na huge wall cubbies holds art awards silly memorabilia instance zedds grammy sits next poop emoji n nat end corridor going outside guests pick favorite flavor rainbow skittles machine n nzedd also server room costco room contains anything would need werent able leave house long time n nthe bathrooms feature automated blinds sometimes surprise person taking shower early morning n nthe remotecontrolled curtains zedds bedroom make happiest feature house n noutside pool hidden jacuzzi hot tub thats revealed pools water level drops n nthe kitchen four builtin hibachi grills pot filler stovetop zedd says reason bought house builtin vacuums nnstill havent subscribed architectural digest youtube n nabout architectural digest nthe leading international design authority architectural digest features articles videos best architecture style culture travel shoppingnninside zedds 16 million mansion skittles machine open door architectural digest

42FRgdjveGU,Netflix Acquires Seth Rogen,"World-renowned Canadian person, prolific marijuana-doer, and winner of the 2015 MTV Movie Award for ‚ÄúBest Kiss‚Äù Seth Q. Rogen has entered into a lifetime deal to transfer full ownership of his personal autonomy to Netflix, Inc. \n\n‚ÄúI have known Seth for many years‚Äù said senior Netflix Development Executive Jareth Chumley. ‚ÄúAfter a wrap party in late 2017, Seth approached me and said something like ‚ÄòJesus Fucking Christ Jarbear, I would sell my soul for a fuckin enchilada right now.‚Äô And so basically that was how the idea was born. In the end we settled on a price a little higher than a standard Chili‚Äôs To-Go entree, but I‚Äôll be damned, not by that much.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs a general rule, I don‚Äôt really ‚Äòread‚Äô anything before I sign it,‚Äù replied Rogen when asked about the deal, spilling some beer on his own head as he does the finger-symbol equivalent of air quotes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Danny is for, he handles that for me, mostly,‚Äù gesturing toward an elderly man in a poncho sleeping on the couch behind him. ‚ÄúHey Danny!‚Äù he shouts, unable to wake his senior contract advisor. ‚ÄúI really hope he didn‚Äôt fuck this up. He‚Äôs the reason that Zach and Miri Make a Porno exists.‚Äù\n\nSeth Rogen‚Äôs Hilarity for Charity is the first project where Netflix was able to successfully extract comedy directly from the actor‚Äôs mind. It will stream April 6. While the remaining projects Rogen will be participating in have not yet been finalized, Netflix is considering a live-action Shrek remake, starring Rogen as both the titular character, as well as that character‚Äôs love interest Fiona. There will also be other tasks considered, including some off-camera roles such as ‚Äúexecutive foot massager‚Äù and ‚ÄúQuentin‚Äôs back waxer‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe world really is our oyster here,‚Äù said Netflix Chief Operations Officer Karen Shartwell. ‚ÄúThere really isn‚Äôt anything on earth that we can‚Äôt make him do.‚Äù\n\nWatch Hilarity For Charity on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80189646\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world‚Äôs leading Internet television network with over 117 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films.

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\n\nSuperstar: Brandon Victor Dixon - Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\nhttps://youtu.be/yleuZbY8rKk\n\nNBC on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc",superstar brandon victor dixon jesus christ superstar live concert,brandon victor dixon steps spotlight superstar tim rice andrew lloyd webbers jesus christ superstar live concertn something new coming john legend 46 subscribe get jesus christ superstar live concert socialnnbc youtube nbc nbc tumblr pinterest google instagram nbc trailers full episode highlights previews promos clips digital exclusives nnabout jesus christ superstar live concertnfrom executive producers andrew lloyd webber tim rice marc platt craig zadan neil meron comes nbcs next live musical spectacular groundbreaking rock opera jesus christ superstar live concert set final week jesus life story told perspective infamous betrayer judas iscariot followers flock jesus judas grows concerned jesus becoming arrogant losing sight principles jesus attacks money changers temple judas finally turns teacher setting path tragedy originally conceived concept album hit 1 billboard charts show eventually made way stage 1971 garnered five tony nominations addition winning drama desk award andrew lloyd webber globally celebrated classic comes nbc 2018 oneofakind live staging easter sunday thats sure amaze jawdropping spectacle allstar cast beloved recording artists fresh soundtrack featuring hits heaven minds dont know love superstarnnsuperstar brandon victor dixon jesus christ superstar live concertn youtuben

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\n\nSuperstar: Brandon Victor Dixon - Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\nhttps://youtu.be/yleuZbY8rKk\n\nNBC on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc",superstar brandon victor dixon jesus christ superstar live concert,brandon victor dixon steps spotlight superstar tim rice andrew lloyd webbers jesus christ superstar live concertn listen john legends new single good night smarturlitagoodnightn subscribe get jesus christ superstar live concert socialnnbc youtube nbc nbc tumblr pinterest google instagram nbc trailers full episode highlights previews promos clips digital exclusives nnabout jesus christ superstar live concertnfrom executive producers andrew lloyd webber tim rice marc platt craig zadan neil meron comes nbcs next live musical spectacular groundbreaking rock opera jesus christ superstar live concert set final week jesus life story told perspective infamous betrayer judas iscariot followers flock jesus judas grows concerned jesus becoming arrogant losing sight principles jesus attacks money changers temple judas finally turns teacher setting path tragedy originally conceived concept album hit 1 billboard charts show eventually made way stage 1971 garnered five tony nominations addition winning drama desk award andrew lloyd webber globally celebrated classic comes nbc 2018 oneofakind live staging easter sunday thats sure amaze jawdropping spectacle allstar cast beloved recording artists fresh soundtrack featuring hits heaven minds dont know love superstarnnsuperstar brandon victor dixon jesus christ superstar live concertn youtuben

jZoHuMwZwTk,1899-1902 British Emergency Ration Field Service Oldest MRE Beef Eaten Survival Food Review Test,"Check out what British soldiers ate during The Second Boer Conflict of 1899-1902 when in a last ditch effort ! This is the second oldest thing I've ever eaten (Oldest was that Hardtack) and much unexpected considering this MRE's condition. It was pretty rough - and the smell when cooking the dried beef (Pretty much a pemmican) is nearly indescribable. It was quite the experience. And for old rations up next we will see the next generation in Emergency Rations - (1918). This is pioneering in food technology - the beef was still edible. It was a pulverized, slow cooked, dried, and compressed meat by-product bar. Way ahead of it's time - this was food tech that was adopted by the U.S. Quartermaster Corps of Sustenance and Natick Food Labs decades later.\n\nFor correspondence, or to send a Military Ration for review, my mailing information is: \nSteve1989\n3616 Harden Blvd\n#360\nLakeland, FL 33803 \n\nhttp://www.mremarketplace.com/\n\nhttp://www.mreinfo.com/\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=2821334&ty=h\n\nAnd thank you everyone for watching & subscribing - hope \nyou enjoyed this one, as I certainly did making it!\n-Steve\n** All Music By:  Steve1989 MREinfo **\n\n\nCheck out the other awesome YT reviewers:\n\n\nOldsmokey:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL1wSC0Ntw8KWgTM-TRHFOQ\n\nRC Gusto:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfBEYgWflPKsDI_i6AmD5sA\n\ngschultz9:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/gschultz9\n\nstickyfingaz745:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChEqR37txqYozXbbitVDd7A\n\n\ngundog4314:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7dAKknI_zWUNcz36T0Lp6w\n\nemmymadeinjapan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzqbfYjQmf9nLQPMxVgPhiA\n\nKiwi Dude:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIUTBxBxmMMY2bUJqYITJxw\n\n\nPaul Buikema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ51mn3lFHIyMYxX74ViCPg\n\nElandil:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCspVo4xdz9JPpPV6d6jp9wQ\n\nMrBrowningm1911\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVoA8_rDsAcMF2UkfCO4n4A\n\ndingo7055:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8dvHS5J4Kqn79p6ScmWqw\n\nSparrowMedicine:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8TnFxqRz-PTS-yowf6S5kw",18991902 british emergency ration field service oldest mre beef eaten survival food review test,check british soldiers ate second boer conflict 18991902 last ditch effort second oldest thing ive ever eaten oldest hardtack much unexpected considering mres condition pretty rough smell cooking dried beef pretty much pemmican nearly indescribable quite experience old rations next see next generation emergency rations 1918 pioneering food technology beef still edible pulverized slow cooked dried compressed meat byproduct bar way ahead time food tech adopted us quartermaster corps sustenance natick food labs decades laternnfor correspondence send military ration review mailing information nsteve1989n3616 harden blvdn360nlakeland fl 33803 nn thank everyone watching subscribing hope nyou enjoyed one certainly making itnsteven music steve1989 mreinfo nnncheck awesome yt reviewersnnnoldsmokeyn guston duden buikeman

ZQ-YX-5bAs0,CRAZY RICH ASIANS - Official Trailer 1,"Every family has its crazy. Watch the new trailer for #CrazyRichAsians, only in theaters this August.\n‚Äî\nCRAZY RICH ASIANS follows native New Yorker Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) as she accompanies her longtime boyfriend, Nick Young (Henry Golding), to his best friend‚Äôs wedding in Singapore. Excited about visiting Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick‚Äôs family, Rachel is unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a few key details about his life. It turns out that he is not only the scion of one of the country‚Äôs wealthiest families but also one of its most sought-after bachelors. Being on Nick‚Äôs arm puts a target on Rachel‚Äôs back, with jealous socialites and, worse, Nick‚Äôs own disapproving mother (Michelle Yeoh) taking aim. And it soon becomes clear that while money can‚Äôt buy love, it can definitely complicate things.\n \nDirected by Jon M. Chu (‚ÄúNow You See Me 2‚Äù)  and based on the acclaimed worldwide bestseller by Kevin Kwan, the film features an international cast of stars, led by Constance Wu (‚ÄúFresh Off the Boat‚Äù); Henry Golding, making his feature film debut; Gemma Chan (‚ÄúHumans‚Äù); Lisa Lu (‚Äú2012‚Äù); and Awkwafina (upcoming ‚ÄúOcean‚Äôs 8,‚Äù ‚ÄúNeighbors 2‚Äù); with Ken Jeong (the ‚ÄúHangover‚Äù films‚Äù) and Michelle Yeoh (‚ÄúStar Trek: Discovery,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon‚Äù).  The large starring ensemble also includes Sonoya Mizuno (‚ÄúLa La Land‚Äù), Chris Pang (‚ÄúMarco Polo‚Äù), Jimmy O. Yang (‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù), comedian Ronny Chieng (‚ÄúThe Daily Show‚Äù), Remi Hii (‚ÄúMarco Polo‚Äù), Nico Santos (‚ÄúSuperstore‚Äù) and Jing Lusi (‚ÄúStan Lee‚Äôs Lucky Man‚Äù).\n \nColor Force‚Äôs Nina Jacobson (‚ÄúThe Hunger Games‚Äù films) and Brad Simpson (‚ÄúWorld War Z‚Äù), and Ivanhoe‚Äôs John Penotti (‚ÄúHell or High Water‚Äù) produced the film, with Tim Coddington, Robert Friedland, Sidney Kimmel and Kevin Kwan serving as executive producers.

ZQ-YX-5bAs0,CRAZY RICH ASIANS - Official Trailer 1,"Every family has its crazy. Watch the new trailer for #CrazyRichAsians, only in theaters this August.‚ÄîCRAZY RICH ASIANS follows native New Yorker Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) as she accompanies her longtime boyfriend, Nick Young (Henry Golding), to his best friend‚Äôs wedding in Singapore. Excited about visiting Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick‚Äôs family, Rachel is unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a few key details about his life. It turns out that he is not only the scion of one of the country‚Äôs wealthiest families but also one of its most sought-after bachelors. Being on Nick‚Äôs arm puts a target on Rachel‚Äôs back, with jealous socialites and, worse, Nick‚Äôs own disapproving mother (Michelle Yeoh) taking aim. And it soon becomes clear that while money can‚Äôt buy love, it can definitely complicate things. Directed by Jon M. Chu (‚ÄúNow You See Me 2‚Äù)  and based on the acclaimed worldwide bestseller by Kevin Kwan, the film features an international cast of stars, led by Constance Wu (‚ÄúFresh Off the Boat‚Äù); Henry Golding, making his feature film debut; Gemma Chan (‚ÄúHumans‚Äù); Lisa Lu (‚Äú2012‚Äù); and Awkwafina (upcoming ‚ÄúOcean‚Äôs 8,‚Äù ‚ÄúNeighbors 2‚Äù); with Ken Jeong (the ‚ÄúHangover‚Äù films‚Äù) and Michelle Yeoh (‚ÄúStar Trek: Discovery,‚Äù ‚ÄúCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon‚Äù).  The large starring ensemble also includes Sonoya Mizuno (‚ÄúLa La Land‚Äù), Chris Pang (‚ÄúMarco Polo‚Äù), Jimmy O. Yang (‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù), comedian Ronny Chieng (‚ÄúThe Daily Show‚Äù), Remi Hii (‚ÄúMarco Polo‚Äù), Nico Santos (‚ÄúSuperstore‚Äù) and Jing Lusi (‚ÄúStan Lee‚Äôs Lucky Man‚Äù). Color Force‚Äôs Nina Jacobson (‚ÄúThe Hunger Games‚Äù films) and Brad Simpson (‚ÄúWorld War Z‚Äù), and Ivanhoe‚Äôs John Penotti (‚ÄúHell or High Water‚Äù) produced the film, with Tim Coddington, Robert Friedland, Sidney Kimmel and Kevin Kwan serving as executive producers.

jZoHuMwZwTk,1899-1902 British Emergency Ration Field Service Oldest MRE Beef Eaten Survival Food Review Test,"Check out what British soldiers ate during The Second Boer Conflict of 1899-1902 when in a last ditch effort ! This is the second oldest thing I've ever eaten (Oldest was that Hardtack) and much unexpected considering this MRE's condition. It was pretty rough - and the smell when cooking the dried beef (Pretty much a pemmican) is nearly indescribable. It was quite the experience. And for old rations up next we will see the next generation in Emergency Rations - (1918). This is pioneering in food technology - the beef was still edible. It was a pulverized, slow cooked, dried, and compressed meat by-product bar. Way ahead of it's time - this was food tech that was adopted by the U.S. Quartermaster Corps of Sustenance and Natick Food Labs decades later.For correspondence, or to send a Military Ration for review, my mailing information is: Steve19893616 Harden Blvd#360Lakeland, FL 33803 http://www.mremarketplace.com/http://www.mreinfo.com/https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2821334&ty=hAnd thank you everyone for watching & subscribing - hope you enjoyed this one, as I certainly did making it!-Steve** All Music By:  Steve1989 MREinfo **Check out the other awesome YT reviewers:Oldsmokey:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL1wSC0Ntw8KWgTM-TRHFOQRC Gusto:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfBEYgWflPKsDI_i6AmD5sAgschultz9:https://www.youtube.com/user/gschultz9stickyfingaz745:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChEqR37txqYozXbbitVDd7Agundog4314:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7dAKknI_zWUNcz36T0Lp6wemmymadeinjapan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzqbfYjQmf9nLQPMxVgPhiAKiwi Dude:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIUTBxBxmMMY2bUJqYITJxwPaul Buikema:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ51mn3lFHIyMYxX74ViCPgElandil:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCspVo4xdz9JPpPV6d6jp9wQMrBrowningm1911https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVoA8_rDsAcMF2UkfCO4n4Adingo7055:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8dvHS5J4Kqn79p6ScmWqwSparrowMedicine:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8TnFxqRz-PTS-yowf6S5kw",18991902 british emergency ration field service oldest mre beef eaten survival food review test,check british soldiers ate second boer conflict 18991902 last ditch effort second oldest thing ive ever eaten oldest hardtack much unexpected considering mres condition pretty rough smell cooking dried beef pretty much pemmican nearly indescribable quite experience old rations next see next generation emergency rations 1918 pioneering food technology beef still edible pulverized slow cooked dried compressed meat byproduct bar way ahead time food tech adopted us quartermaster corps sustenance natick food labs decades laterfor correspondence send military ration review mailing information steve19893616 harden blvd360lakeland fl 33803 thank everyone watching subscribing hope enjoyed one certainly making itsteve music steve1989 mreinfo check awesome yt reviewersoldsmokey gusto dude buikema

This pool challenge was crazy as we filled my pool with 1,000 POOL floaties. We grabbed as many pool toys and pool floats as we could fin and dumped them in my pool. We played different pool games like floor is lava challenge and hide and seek in the pool. We even had the idea to maybe make a box fort or flute fort out of all these pool toys and try to survive in it for 24 hours just like in one of our 24 hour box fort challenges. Maybe in the next funny video we will take it a step farther and fill my pool with orbeez or water beads!   Giant balloon what happens if you orbeez into a balloon in a pool party? Say what comedy.
