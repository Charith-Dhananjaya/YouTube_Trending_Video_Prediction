 How many days? Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know? Something was it right here? Oh baby, baby, I shouldn't hurt you, go. And now you're at a site here. Show me how you want it to be. Tell me baby, cause I need to know now. Because my loneliness is giving me a hand. I must confess I still believe in somebody. When I'm not with you, I lose my mind. Give me a say. It made it one more time. Baby, baby, there is a reason I'm free. This year. Boy, you got me playing it. Oh baby, baby, there's nothing that I shouldn't do. It's not the way I planned. Show me how you want it to be. Tell me baby, cause I need to know now. Because loneliness is giving me a hand. I must confess I still believe in somebody. When I'm not with you, I lose my mind. Give me a say. I'm not that innocent, baby.
